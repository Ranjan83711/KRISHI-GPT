Despite the fact that the country faces extreme weather conditions, the State of Tamil Nadu retained its glory by getting the Krishi Karman Award 2019 for the fifth time in a row for continued enhancement of food grain and oilseed production. The data vividly indicate the successful accomplishments of both scientists of TNAU and officials in the Department of Agriculture in the past several years.

The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, is playing a pivotal role in design and development of crop varieties, technologies and farm implements to suit the prevailing situations and adapt to the climate change scenarios. In this context, there was an urgent need for standard operational protocols and technology package of practices to fit various agro-climatic zones of the state of Tamil Nadu. In this context, the TNAU under the dynamic leadership of the Vice Chancellor, Director of Research and other technical directors, the \u201cCrop Production Guide (CPG) \u2013 Agriculture 2020\u201d was revised, updated and put together as a technology capsule prescribed for adoption by the Department of Agriculture and in turn to the farmers of the State. While doing the revision, the Director of Agriculture and entire team of Department officials ensured that the field level problems are addressed. The CPG - Agriculture 2020 carries recommended crops and varieties, seed to seed crop management technologies, seed invigoration techniques, soil-test crop response based fertilizer prescription, drip fertigation, integrated weed management practices, technology capsule for pests and diseases management, labour saving farm machineries and post-harvest management practices. I take this opportunity to thank and the Vice Chancellor, Director of Agriculture, Director of Research, other Technical Directors and Department officials for their assiduous efforts to orchestrate the document that serve as the base for the agricultural growth and development in the State of Tamil Nadu. (Gagandeep Singh Bedi) Dr. N. Kumar, Ph.D., Vice Chancellor Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Coimbatore 641 003 PREFACE The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, is one of the best State Agricultural Universities in the country, evolving several crop varieties, technologies and farm implements to promote productivity and profitability of farms while ensuring environmental safety and rural livelihood. The TNAU has a well articulated and structured research framework to develop varieties and technologies to enable adoption by the farmers of the State. The Research Council of TNAU identifies the field problems that are developed as research projects, monitored and evaluated during the annual crop scientists meets and the research outcomes are presented to the State level Scientific Workers Conference to take the final decision on the varieties or technologies to be recommended for adoption.

Whereas, un-puddled lowland cultivation undergoes different environments like, dry seeding exclusively with rainfall, locally called as \u2018rainfed rice\u2019, with supplemental irrigation during peak vegetative and reproductive phases by the rain water collected / harvested in tanks (\u2018semi-dry rice\u2019) and also assured irrigation from canal after 30-45 days of dry situation (also called semi-dry rice) . They are grouped as follows: 1. Transplanted puddled lowland rice 2. Direct seeded lowland rice a. Wet seeded rice in puddled soil b. Dry seeded rice in un-puddled soil i) Rainfed ii) Semi dry - supplemental irrigation iii) Semi dry - canal irrigation* (contingent crop) 3. Dry seeded upland rice \u2013 This system of rice cultivation is there in areas with high rainfall (like Assam and NE frontiers of India) where the land is slopy and terraced and there is no possibility for bunding to stagnate the water. Grain yield is poor due to loss of nutrients and soil mainly caused by water erosion. Moisture availability is mostly at saturation or at wet range. There is very limited area in Dharmapuri district, Tamil Nadu. 4. Deep water rice cultivation exists in certain pockets of Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts particularly during NE monsoon with heavy downpour. 16 1.

Treat the seeds in Carbendazim or Pyroquilon or Tricyclozole solution at 2 g/l of water for 1 kg of seeds. Soak the seeds in water for 10 hrs and drain excess water. b. This wet seed treatment gives protection to the seedlings up to 40 days from seedling disease such as blast and this method is better than dry seed treatment. c. If the seeds are required for sowing immediately, keep the soaked seed in gunny in dark and cover with extra gunnies and leave for 24hrs for sprouting. d. Seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens: Treat the seeds with talc based formulation of Pseudomonas fluorescens 10g/kg of seed and soak in 1lit of water overnight. Decant the excess water and allow the seeds to sprout for 24hrs and then sow. e. Seed treatment with biofertilizers : Five packets (1kg/ha) each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria or five packets (1kg/ha) of Azophos bioinoculants are mixed with sufficient water wherein the seeds are soaked overnight before sowing in the nursery bed (The bacterial suspension after decanting may be poured over the nursery area itself).

Sowing \u2022 Sow the sprouted seeds uniformly on the seedbed having thin film of water in the surface. Water Management \u2022 Drain the water 18 to 24 hrs after sowing \u2022 Care must be taken to avoid stagnation of water on the seedbed. \u2022 Allow enough water to saturate the soil from 3rd to 5th day. From 5th day onwards, increase the water depth to 1.5 cm depending on the height of the seedlings. \u2022 Thereafter maintain 2.5 cm depth of water. Weed Management \u2022 Apply any one of the pre-emergence herbicides viz., Pyrazosulfuron ethyl @ 20 g/ha on 3rd or 4th day after sowing to control weeds in the lowland nursery. Keep a thin film of water and allow it to disappear. Avoid drainage of water. This will control germinating weeds. \u2022 Pre-emergence herbicide Butachlor 1.0 l/ha (or) Pendimethalin 1.0 l/ha.

Main Field Management 1.2.1. Land preparation \u2022 Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land. \u2022 Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water. \u2022 Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling. \u2022 Special technologies for problem soils: a) For fluffy paddy soils: compact the soil by passing 400kg stone roller or oil- drum with stones inside, eight times at proper moisture level (moisture level at friable condition of soil which is approximately 13 to18%) once in three years, to prevent the sinking of draught animals and workers during puddling. b) For sodic soils with pH values of more than 8.5, plough at optimum moisture regime, apply gypsum at 50% gypsum requirement uniformly, impound water, provide drainage for leaching out soluble salts and apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha, 10 to 15 days before transplanting.

Mix 37.5 kg of zinc sulphate per ha with sand to make a total quantity of 75 kg and spread the mixture uniformly on the leveled field. Do not incorporate the mixture in the soil. Rice under sodic soil responds well to these practices. c) For saline soils with EC values of more than 4 dS/m, provide lateral and main drainage channels (60cm deep and 45cm wide), apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha at 10 to 15 days before transplanting and 25% extra dose of nitrogen in addition to recommended P and K and ZnSO 4 d) For acid soils apply lime based on the soil analysis for obtaining normal rice yields. Lime is applied 2.5 t/ha before last ploughing. Apply lime at this rate to each crop up to the 5th crop. 1.2.2.Stand Establishment Optimum age of seedlings for quick establishment \u2022 Optimum age of the seedlings is 18-22 days for short, 25-30 days for medium and 35-40 days for long duration varieties. 19 Pulling out the seedlings \u2022 Pull out the seedlings at the appropriate time (4th leaf stage). \u2022 Pulling at 3rd leaf stage is also possible. These seedlings can produce more tillers, provided enough care taken during the establishment phase (See section 1.8 Integrated Crop Management (ICM) - Rice-SRI) through thin film of water management and perfect leveling of main field. \u2022 Transplanting after 5th and higher order leaf numbers will affect the performance of the crop and grain yield. Then they are called as \u2018aged seedlings\u2019. Special package is needed to minimize the grain yield loss while planting those aged seedlings.

Water management \u2022 Puddling and leveling minimizes the water requirement \u2022 Plough with tractor drawn cage wheel to reduce percolation losses and to save water requirement up to 20%. \u2022 Maintain 2.5cm of water over the puddle and allow the green manure to decompose for a minimum of 7 days in the case of less fibrous plants like sunnhemp and 15 days for more fibrous green manure plants like Kolinchi (Tephrosia purpurea). \u2022 At the time of transplanting, a shallow depth of 2cm of water is adequate since high depth of water will lead to deep planting resulting in reduction of tillering. 25 \u2022 Maintain 2 cm of water up to seven days of transplanting. \u2022 After the establishment stage, cyclic submergence of water (as in table) is the best practice for rice crop.

Days after disappearance of ponded water at which irrigation is to be given Soil type Summer Winter Loamy 1 day 3 days Clay Just before/immediately 1 - 2 days after disappearance \u2022 Moisture stress due to inadequate water at rooting and tillering stage causes poor root growth leading to reduction in tillering, poor stand and low yield. \u2022 Critical stages of water requirement in rice are a) panicle initiation, b) booting, c) heading and d) flowering. During these stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated time so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level. \u2022 During booting and maturity stages continuous inundation of 5cm and above leads to advancement in root decay and leaf senescence, delay in heading and reduction in the number of filled grains per panicle and poor harvest index. \u2022 Provide adequate drainage facilities to drain excess water or strictly follow irrigation schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded water. Last irrigation may be 15 days ahead of harvest. Precautions for irrigation \u2022 The field plot size can be 25 to 50 cents depending on the source of irrigation. \u2022 Field to field irrigation should be avoided. Field should be irrigated individually from a channel. \u2022 Small bund may be formed parallel to the main bund of the field at a distance of 30 to 45 cm within the field to avoid leakages of water through main bund crevices. \u2022 To minimize percolation loss, the depth of stagnated water should be 5 cm or less. \u2022 In water logged condition, form open drains, about 60 cm in depth and 45 cm width across the field. \u2022 Care should be taken not to allow development of cracks. \u2022 In canal command area, conjunctive use of surface and ground water may be resorted to for judicious use of water. Alternate Wetting and Drying Irrigation (AWDI) \u2022 Safe Alternate Wetting and Drying Irrigation (AWDI) is to monitor the depth of ponded water on the field using \u2018Field Water Tube\u2019 (FWT) which is made of 40 cm long plastic pipe with a diameter of 15 cm so that water table is easily visible. \u2022 Tube is perforated with 0.5 cm diameter holes in the bottom and the top 15 cm portion is non-perforated. 26 \u2022 Above the", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

The soil inside the tube is to be removed. \u2022 FWT to be installed near the field levies so that the water level inside the FWT could be monitored easily. \u2022 Safe AWDI of 10 cm depletion in light soils and 15 cm depletion in heavy soils was found to improve the water use efficiency in rice. Non-Puddled machine Transplanted Rice (NPTR) \u2022 Traditional transplanted rice cultivation requires 1200-1400 mm of water of which puddling consumes 250 mm of water. \u2022 In NPTR, puddling is replaced with dry ploughing (using cultivator and rotavator) followed by laser leveling and wetting. \u2022 Soil is allowed to settle for 12-24 hrs before transplanting very light irrigation is given again to maintain a uniform depth of 1 cm standing water. \u2022 Machine transplanting is adopted in the wetted soil. \u2022 Alternate Wetting and Drying Irrigation method is followed for water management. \u2022 Though there was a yield reduction, considerable water saving under NPTR from 120 to 245 mm. 1.3. Insect management: See Crop Protection Chapter 1.4. Disease management: See Crop Protection Chapter 1.5. Harvesting \u2022 Taking the average duration of the crop as an indication, drain the water from the field 7 to 10 days before the expected harvest date as draining hastens maturity and improves harvesting conditions. \u2022 When 80% of the panicles turn straw colour, the crop is ready for harvest. Even at this stage, the leaves of some of the varieties may remain green. \u2022 Confirm maturity by selecting the most mature tiller and dehusk a few grains.

Parboiling is a hydrothermal treatment followed by drying before milling for the production of milled parboiled grain. Parboiling of paddy has been known in the orient for centuries. Nearly 50 per cent of the paddy produced in India at present is parboiled. 5.14.24. In general, the three major steps in parboiling, i.e. soaking, steaming and drying and have a great influence on the final characteristics and quality of parboiled rice. 5.14.25. Parboiling is the latest premilling treatment which improves the quality of rice. The traditional parboiling process in India is carried out in different ways.

On stirring, rice begins to crackle and swell. Then the content of the pan are removed and sieved to separate the parched rice from sand. Parboiled rice is used for making grayish to brilliant white colour parched rice and sold either salted or unsalted. It is eaten as such or mixed with butter milk or milk. Expanded cereals Expanded rice (Pori) * 5.14.26. Expanded rice (murmura, pori, muri) is a traditional convenience food widely consumed in India either as such or with Jaggery, roasted Bengal gram and shredded vegetables and spices. The product is mostly produced in home or cottage sector by skilled artisans. 5.14.27. In the traditional process, the paddy is soaked in water preferably over night until saturation, drained and then either steamed or dry roasted in sand for parboiling. The parboiled paddy is milled, salted and again roasted in sand for expansion.

It is then mixed with salt solution and again roasted on furnace in small batches with sand on a strong fire for a few seconds to produce the expanded rice. Rice expands about 8 times retaining the grain shape and is highly porous and crisp. Parched paddy or puffed rice: (using paddy) Sun dried paddy is filled in mud jars and is moistened with hot water. After 2-3 min. the water is decanted and the jars are kept in an inverted position for 8-10 hours. Next the paddy is exposed to the sun for a short time and then parched in hot sand as in the preparation of parched rice. Puffed rice is prepared by throwing pretreated paddy into sand heated to a high temperature in an iron pan. During parching the grain swell and burst into a soft white product. The parched grains are sieved to remove sand and winnowed to separate the husk. Puffed rice from parboiled rice The rice is soaked in salt water to increase the moisture to about 20%. The moist rice is introduced into a hot vessel at about 250-275oC for 30-40 seconds. The rice puffs suddenly. Popped rice This is yet another traditional value added product prepared from raw paddy. The paddy at a moisture content of 12-14% is directly roasted in iron pans using sand as a medium at a temperature of 150-200oC. The production of popped rice is comparatively less and the product is mainly used in religious functions and ceremonies.

The husk is separated by winnowing. Flaked rice is thin and papery and of white colour. Quick cooking rice is made by steeping polished rice in water to a moisture content of 35 per cent, cooking under pressure and drying. Alternatively the rice may be subjected to freezing, thawing and dehydration. Derived products 43 Polished rice may be precooked and canned as rice pudding and also used to make dry breakfast cereals. RICE AND RICE PRODUCTS Modernization of rice milling Industry also results in production of quality by-products viz., broken rice, husk and rice bran. Technology is now available for the production of value- added products from these by-products. Byproducts of Rice Broken rice The broken rice is widely used in the food preparations and in the industries for making flour and in the manufacture of baby foods. The starch extracted from broken rice finds wider application in the pharmaceutical, textile and other industries. Rice husk Rice husk that contains about 38% cellulose and 32% lignin and is one of the most abundant renewable agriculture based fuel materials. The production of rice husk is about 80 million tonnes per year, equivalent in energy to about 170 million barrels of oil. Paddy husk contains about 22 per cent ash of which 95 per cent is silica. Because of its high silica content, it is used as an abrasive. Large quantities of husk are used in India as fuel for boilers, kilns and household purposes. Rice bran Commercially rice bran is the most valuable by-product, which is characterized by its high fat (15 to 20%) and protein content. It also contains vitamins, minerals and many other useful chemicals. It is a potential source of edible oil. Because of its nutritional value, it is being used as feed for poultry and livestock. More stable defatted bran containing higher percentage of protein, vitamins and minerals is an excellent ingredient for both food and feed.

The bran is the most nutritious byproduct of rice milling and is used almost exclusively as a feedstuff. It is generally contaminated with husk, which lowers its nutritive value. Rice bran contains about 12 per cent protein and 15 per cent fat. Rice bran oil Bran oil is obtained by the extraction of rice bran with solvents. Bran oil is also obtained in the solvent extraction milling of rice. The oil contains a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids, yet it is quite stable because of the presence of natural antioxidants. When refined, bleached and deodorized, it is used for salad dressing and as cooking oil. Bran after solvent extraction has a higher percentage of protein that the original material. With its low fat content it keeps well. Importance Rice bran oil is the oil extracted from the germ and inner husk of rice. Rice bran oil is rich in vitamin E, \u03b3-oryzanol (an antioxidant that may help prevent heart attacks) and phytosterols (compounds believed to help lower cholesterol absorption) which may provide associated health benefits. It has a mild taste and is popular in Asian cuisine because of its suitability for high- temperature cooking methods such as deep-frying and stir-frying. Rice bran oil is mostly monounsaturated - a tablespoon contains 7 grams of monounsaturated 44 fat, three of saturated fat and five of polyunsaturated fat. Rice bran oil also contains components of vitamin E that may benefit health. The unique components, such as oryzanol or tocotrienol, have been drawing people's attention. Numerous studies show rice bran oil reduces the harmful cholesterol (LDL) without reducing good cholesterol (HDL). In those studies, Oryzanol is reported as the key element responsible for that function. Tocotrienol, on the other hand, is highlighted as the most precious and powerful vitamin E existing in nature and is said to have an anti-cancer effect, too. As a Vitamin-E source, rice bran oil is rich not only in alpha Tocopherol but also has the highest amount of Tocotrienol in liquid form vegetable oils. Uses Rice bran oil is ideal oil for margarine and shortening. The flavor gives the good palatability and the desired prime form crystal provides smooth plasticity and spreading qualities.

When processed to retain high levels of tocols, rice bran oil may be used as a natural antioxidant source for topically coating a wide range of products such as crackers, nuts, and similar snacks to extend shelf life. Rice polishing Rice polishing is also rich in nutrients. They are not recovered in sizeable quantity in India. They are mostly used as animal feed. Uses of defatted bran and bran Defatted bran can be successfully used as an ingredient in the bakery products such as bread, cake, biscuits etc. After finer grinding, it can be incorporated into maida flour up to 20 per cent for the preparation of bakery products.

Quantity of seed required Irrigated Transplanted - 7.5 kg/ha; Direct sown - 10 kg/ha Rainfed Direct sown - 15 kg/ha Sorghum under irrigated condition is raised both as a direct sown and transplanted crop. Transplanted crop has the following advantages: a. Main field duration is reduced by 10 days. b. Shoot fly, which attacks direct sown crops during the first 3 weeks and which is difficult to control, can be effectively and economically controlled in the nursery itself. c. Seedlings which show chlorotic and downy mildew symptoms can be eliminated, thereby incidence of downy mildew in the main field can be minimised. d. Optimum population can be maintained as only healthy seedlings are used for transplanting. e. Seed rate can also be reduced by 2.5 kg/ha. II. NURSERY PRACTICES 1. NURSERY PREPARATION For raising seedlings to plant one hectare, select 7.5 cents (300 m2 ) near a water source where water will not stagnate. 2. APPLICATION OF FYM TO THE NURSERY i. Apply 750 kg of FYM or compost for 7.5 cents nursery and apply another 500 kg of compost or FYM for covering the seeds after sowing. ii. Spread the manure evenly on the unploughed soil and incorporate by ploughing or apply just before last ploughing. 66 3. LAYING THE NURSERY i. Provide three separate units of size 2 m x 1.5 m with 30 cm space in between the plots and all around the unit for irrigation. ii. Excavate the soil from the inter-space and all around to a depth of 15 cm to form channels and spread the soil removed on the bed and level. 4. PRE-TREATMENT OF SEEDS i. Treat the seeds 24 hours prior to sowing with Carbendazim or Captan or Thiram at 2g/kg of seed. ii. Carrier based formulation: Treat one hectare of seeds with 1 kg each of biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria (or) Azophos, Silicate solubilizing bacteria (SSB) / Potash bacteria (KRB) and 25 g of powder formulation of AM fungi using binder (polymer), shade dry for 30 minutes before sowing. iii. Liquid formulation: Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of each biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria (or) Azophos and Silicate solubilizing bacteria (SSB) shade dry for 30 minutes before sowing 5.

Liquid formulation: Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of each biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria (or) Azophos and Silicate solubilizing bacteria (SSB) shade dry for 30 minutes before sowing 5. SOWING AND COVERING THE SEEDS 1. Make shallow rills, not deeper than 1 cm on the bed by passing the fingers vertically over it. 2. Broadcast 7.5 kg of treated seeds evenly on the beds. 3. Cover by leveling the rills by passing the hand lightly over the soil. 6. WATER MANAGEMENT i. Provide one inlet to each nursery unit. ii. Allow water to enter through the inlet and cover all the channels till the raised beds are covered with water and then cut off. iii. Adjust the frequency of irrigation according to the soil types as follows: Number of irrigations Red soil Heavy soil First irrigation Immediately after sowing Immediately after sowing Second irrigation 3rd day after sowing 4th day after sowing Third irrigation 7th day after sowing 9th day after sowing Fourth irrigation 12th day after sowing 16th day after sowing NOTE: Do not keep the seedlings in the nursery for more than 18 days. If older seedlings are used, establishment and yield are adversely affected. Do not allow cracks to develop in the nursery by properly adjusting the quantity of irrigation water. MAIN FIELD PREPARATION FOR IRRIGATED CROP 1. PLOUGHING Plough the field with an iron plough once (or) twice. Sorghum does not require fine tilth since it adversely affects germination and yield in the case of direct sown crop. To overcome the subsoil hard pan in Alfisols (deep red soils) chiselling the field at 0.5 m 67 intervals to a depth of 40 cm on both the directions of the field followed by disc ploughing once and cultivator ploughing twice help to increase the yield of sorghum and the succeeding crops. Application of FYM and 100% of recommended N can also be followed. In soils with sub- soil hard pan, chiselling should be done every year at the start of the cropping sequence to create a favourable physical environment. 2. APPLICATION OF FYM Spread 12.5 t/ha FYM or any compost along with 2 kg each Azospirillum, Phosphobacteria or 2 kg of Azophos on the unploughed field and incorporate the manure in the soil. Apply well decomposed poultry manure @ 5 t/ha to improve the grain yield", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Regulate irrigation depending upon the prevailing weather conditions and receipt of rain. V. HARVESTING 1. DECIDE WHEN TO HARVEST i. Ragi crop does not mature uniformly and hence the harvest is to be taken up in 97 two stages. ii. When the earhead on the main shoot and 50% of the earheads on the crop turn brown, the crop is ready for the first harvest. 2. HARVEST OF THE CROP First harvest i. Cut all earheads which have turned brown. ii. Dry, thresh and clean the grains by winnowing. Second Harvest i. Seven days after the first harvest, cut all the earheads including the green ones. ii. Cure the grains to obtain maturity by heaping the harvested earheads in shade for one day without drying, so that the humidity and temperature increase and the grains get cured. iii. Dry, thresh and clean the grains by winnowing and store the grains in gunnies. Threshing Green earheads if harvested will contaminate the seeds with immature seeds and interfere cleaning, drying and grading. Dry earheads until seed moisture content reaches 15% and separate manually by threshing with bamboo stick or machine thresher. Precleaning and drying Threshed seeds should be precleaned before sundrying, seeds must be dried to 12% moisture content before grading. Protection from storage pests 1. Grain purpose: Dry the seeds adequately to reduce the moisture level to 10%. 2. Seed purpose: Admix one kg of Activated kaolin or Malathion 5% D for every 100 kg of seed.

Rainfed ragi: Azospirillum mixed with FYM and applied to field saves the cost of nitrogen by 50% with a comparable yield obtained with 40 kg N/ha. iii. Management of aged seedlings of ragi under rainfed conditions: When planting ragi seedlings beyond 21 days, increase the number of seedlings to 3/hill and increase N level by 25% to minimise yield loss. iv. Apply VAM culture (Glomus fasciculatum) at 100 g/m2 in the nursery and also treat with Azospirillum and Phosphobacterium as seed treatment, seedling dip and field application to reduce the reniform nematode population in ragi. RAGI : RAINFED Rainfall Average and well distributed rainfall of 450-500 mm is optimum for rainfed ragi 98 Season Finger millet is grown in different seasons in different parts of the country. As a rainfed crop, it is normally sown in June- July in Tamil Nadu. It also grown in winter season (rabi) by planting in September \u2013 October in Tamil Nadu and as a summer irrigated crop by planting January \u2013 February. Tillage Fall ploughing is advantageous for moisture conservation. In the month of April or May, one deep ploughing with mould board plough followed by ploughing with wooden plough twice is necessary. Before sowing secondary tillage with cultivator and multiple tooth hoe to prepare smooth seed bed is necessary. Seed rate and planting A plant population of 4 \u2013 5 lakhs per ha is optimum for getting higher yields and higher or lower population than the optimum will reduce the yield. Line sowing is ideal and seed drills giving spacing of 22.5 \u2013 30 cm between rows should be used. Finger millet seeds are very small (400 seeds/g) and the recommended seed rate is 10 kg/ha. Therefore, even when seed drill is used thinning within the row leaving a spacing of 7.5 \u2013 10 cm between plants, must be followed. Sowing by seed-cum-fertilizer drill is advantageous for line sowing besides efficient utilization of applied nutrients. Maintenance of optimum plant population is an important prerequisite for getting higher yield under rainfed conditions. Poor germination, often, is the result", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Sowing by seed-cum-fertilizer drill is advantageous for line sowing besides efficient utilization of applied nutrients. Maintenance of optimum plant population is an important prerequisite for getting higher yield under rainfed conditions. Poor germination, often, is the result of inadequate moisture after sowing in low rainfall areas. Under these conditions, the adoption of a simple technique like seed hardening will not only improve germination and subsequent plant stand but also impart early seedling vigour and tolerance to drought. The procedure of seed hardening technique is as follows. 1. Sole seeds in water for 6 hours. Use one litre water for every kg seed for soaking. 2. Drain the water and keep the seeds in wet cloth bag tightly tied for two days. 3. At this stage, the seeds will show initial signs of germination. 4. Remove seeds from the wet cloth bag and dry them in shade on a dry cloth for 2 days. 5. Use the above hardened seeds for sowing. 99 Manuring and fertilization Finger millet responds well to fertilizer application especially to N and P. The recommended doses of fertilizers vary from state to state for rainfed crop. Recommended dose of 40:20:20 kg/ha N:P:K was applied. With judicious application of farmyard manure inorganic fertilizer efficiency is enhanced. Entire P O and K O are to be applied at sowing, whereas 2 5 2 nitrogen is to be applied in two or three split doses depending upon moisture availability. In areas of good rainfall and moisture availability, 50% of recommended nitrogen is to be applied at sowing and the remaining 50% in two equal splits at 25-30 and 40-45 days after sowing. In areas of uncertain rainfall, 50% at sowing and the remaining 50% around 35 days after sowing is recommended. Bio-fertilizers Treating seeds with Azospirillum brasilense (N fixing bacterium) and Aspergillus awamori (P solubilizing fungs) @ 25 g/kg seed is beneficial. In case seeds are to be treated with seed dressing chemicals, treat the seeds first with seed dressing chemicals and then with bio- fertilizers at the time of sowing. Procedures for inoculating seeds with biofertilizers 1. Bio-fertilizer culture specific to the crop is to be used @ 25 g per kg of seed. 2.

Sticker solution is necessary for effective seed inoculation. This can be prepared by dissolving 25 g jaggery or sugar in 250 ml water and boiling for 5 minutes. The solution thus prepared is cooled. 3. Smear the seeds well using the required quantity of sticker solution. Then add culture to the seeds and mix thoroughly so as to get a fine coating of culture on the seed. 4. The culture-coated seeds is to be dried well in shade to avoid clumping of seeds. 5. Use the inoculated seeds for sowing. Weed control i. In line sown crop 2-3 inter-cultivations are necessary. In assured rainfall and irrigated areas spraying 2,4-D sodium salt @ 0.75 kg.a.i./ha as post-emergent spray on 20-25 days after sowing effectively controls weeds. ii. Apply, Isoproturon @ 0.5 a.i/ha as pre-emergence on 3 DAS is also effective in control of weeds. In broadcast crop two effective hand weedings will minimize weeds as inter cultivations is not possible. iii. For direct sown rainfed ragi post-emergence application of 2, 4 D Na salt (or) EE formulation at 0.5 kg ha-1 applied on 10 days after sowing and at 0.75 kg ha-1 applied on 15 days after sowing will give effective weed control as well as higher grain yield. Cropping systems Crop rotation Rotation with legumes like greengram / blackgram / field bean / soybean / horse gram or ground nut in southern state will minimize inorganic fertilizer application and also sustain higher yields. Intercropping Finger millet based inter cropping system with pigeon pea at 4:1 ratio is recommended for rainfed situation to obtain high grain yield 100 CROP PROTECTION A.

Multi bloom technology A special technology being practiced in Pattukottai block of Tanjore district for blackgram and greengram. The soil is alluvial and rich in organic matter and nutrients. The crop is sown during early summer (Jan.-Feb.) as normal crop and fertilizer is applied as per the recommendation for irrigated crop. In addition to that, top dressing of Nitrogen is done with an extra dose of 25 to 30 kg through urea. Since pulses are 140 indeterminate growth habit and continue to produce new flashes, the top dressing will be done on 40-45 days after sowing. The crops complete its first flesh of matured pods during 60-65th day, further their second new flesh within 20-25 days. Therefore two fleshes of pods can be harvested at a time within the duration of 100 days. CROP PROTECTION A.

MULTI BLOOM TECHNOLOGY A special technology being practiced in Pattukottai block of Tanjore district for blackgram and greengram. The soil is alluvial and rich in organic matter and nutrients. The crop is sown during early summer (Jan.-Feb.) as normal crop and fertilizer is applied as per the recommendation for irrigated crop. In addition to that, top dressing of Nitrogen is done with an extra dose of 25 to 30 kg through urea. Since pulses are indeterminate in growth habit and continue to produced new flushes, the top dressing will be done on 40-45 days after sowing. The crop complete its first flushes of matured pods during 60-65th day and put further second new flush within 20-25 days. Therefore two flushes of pods can be harvested at a time within the duration of 100 days. CROP PROTECTION A.

Flowering and pod formation stages are critical periods when irrigation is a must. Avoid water stagnation at all stages. Apply KCl at the rate of 0.5 per cent as foliar spray during vegetative stage if there is moisture stress. 8. PRUNING TECHNIQUE A spacing of about 10 feet between lines and four feet between plants are adopted. Pits are dug and two to three seeds are sown in the middle of the pit. One healthy seedling is allowed to grow and the rest removed. The vine is propped with a stick. When the vine reaches the pandal, the terminal bud is nipped. Allow the branches to trail over the pandal. Each branch may be pruned at three feet length so that the pandal is covered with vines. Branches arising on the main vine below the pandal are removed. When flowering starts, prune the tip of the branches bearing inflorescence having three nodes from the productive axil. Continue this procedure throughout the reproductive phase. 9.

SPACING Adopt a spacing of 30 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants. Wherever groundnut ring mosaic (bud necrosis) is prevalent, adopt a spacing of 15cm x 15 cm. 8. SEED TREATMENT i) Treat the seeds with talc formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed. Biocontrol agents are compatible with biofertilizers. Treat the seeds with biocontrol agents first and then with Rhizobium. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible. ii) Treat the seeds with Trichoderma @ 4g/kg. This can be done just before sowing. It is compatible with biofertilizers. SUCH SEEDS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH FUNGICIDES (or) iii) Treat the seeds with Thiram or Mancozeb @ 4 g/kg of seed or Carboxin or Carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seed. iv) Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of Rhizobium (TNAU 14) and 125 ml of Phosphobacteria, shade dry it for 30 minutes before sowing 9. SOWING \u2022 Use Kovai seed drill/gorru to sow the seeds in lines. \u2022 Put one seed in each hole. Protect the seeds from crows and squirrels. 10. INTERCROPPING i) Raise one row of cowpea for every five rows of groundnut wherever red hairy caterpillar is endemic. ii) Raise intercrops like redgram, blackgram, sunflower, gingelly or other pulses. iii) Cumbu can be raised as intercrop. iv) Groundnut + Gingelly or Groundnut + Blackgram in the ratio of 4:1 or Groundnut + Cowpea at 6:1 ratio and Groundnut + Sunflower at 6:2 ratio may be raised. 186 11. WEED MANAGEMENT i) Pre-emergence: Pendimethalin @ 1.0 litre/ha applied through flat fan nozzle with 500 l of water/ha. After 35 - 40 days one hand weeding may be given. ii) If no herbicide is applied two hand weeding may be given on 20th and 40th day after sowing. 12. EARTHING UP Accomplish earthing up during second hand weeding/late hand weeding (in herbicide application). NOTE: i) Earthing up provides medium for the peg development ii) Use the improved hoe with long handle which can be worked more efficiently in a standing position. iii) Do not disturb the soil after 45th day of sowing as it will affect pod formation adversely. 13.

APPLICATION OF CALCIUM SULPHATE (GYPSUM) i) Apply gypsum @ 400 kg/ha by the side of the plants on 40th to 70th day depending upon soil moisture. ii) Apply gypsum, hoe and incorporate it in the soil and then earth up. iii) Avoid gypsum in calciferous soils. iv) Gypsum is effective in soils deficient in calcium and sulphur. NOTE: Application of gypsum encourages pod formation and better filling up of the pods. Application of gypsum at the rate of 50 % basal both in rainfed and irrigated condition reduces Khadhasty malady and pod scab nematode Combined nutrient spray Pod filling is a major problem especially in the bold seed varieties. To improve pod filling spraying of nutrient solution is to be given. This can be prepared by soaking DAP 2.5 kg, Ammonium sulphate 1 kg and borax 0.5 kg in 37 lit of water overnight. The next day morning it can be filtered and about 32 litre of mixture can be obtained and it may be diluted with 468 lit of water so as to made up to 500 litre to spray for one ha. Planofix at the rate of 350 ml. can also be mixed while spraying. This can be sprayed on 25th and 35th day after sowing. 14. HARVESTING i) Observe the crop, considering its average duration. Drying and falling of older leaves and yellowing of the top leaves indicate maturity. ii) Pull out a few plants at random and shell the pods. If the inner shell is brownish black and not white, then the crop has matured. iii) Irrigate prior to harvest, if the soil is dry, as this will facilitate easy harvesting. If there is enough moisture in the soil, there is no need for irrigation for harvesting. iv) If water is not available for irrigating the field prior to harvest, work a mould board plough or work a country plough, so that the plants are uprooted. Engage labour to search pods left out in the soil, if necessary. 187 NOTE: Do not keep the pulled out plants in heaps when they are wet, especially the bunch varieties, as the pods will start sprouting. v) Strip off", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Considering the favourable environment in the Broad beds and furrows system for the development of groundnut pods, with a little modification in the size, beds are to be formed for the polyethylene film mulched groundnut. Make the beds at a width of 60 cm, leaving 15 cm on the either side for the furrows. In a plot size of 4.5 m x 6.0 m, five beds can be made. After the formation of the bed and fertilizer application, spread black polythene sheet (90 cm width) over the soil surface. The edges of the polyethylene can be sheet Seven micron polythene film sheet @50 kg/ha is required. Holes can be made at required spacing of 30 x10 cm before spreading of the sheets. The seed requirement is similar to normal groundnut cultivation 5. APPLICATION OF MICRONUTRIENTS \u2022 Apply TNAU MN mixture @ 12.5 kg /ha as Enriched FYM . (Prepare enriched FYM at 1:10 ratio of MN mixture & FYM ; mix at friable moisture &incubate for one month in shade). \u2022 Broadcast evenly on the soil surface immediately after sowing. Do not incorporate the micronutrient mixture to the soil. \u2022 To increase flower retention, pod filling and to induce drought tolerance apart from yield improvement, 2 sprays of TNAU groundnut rich @ 5.0 kg/ha (for each spray) at 35 DAS ( 50 per cent flowering) and 45 DAS (Pod developing stage) in 500 litres of water is recommended 6. NUTRITIONAL DISORDER Zinc deficiency: Apply 25 kg ZnSO /ha as basal. 4 If soil analysis shows less than 1.2 ppm of zinc, soil application of 25 kg ZnSo is 4 recommended. Reduce ZnSO application from 25.0 kg ha-1 to 12.5 kg ha-1 if FYM is 4 applied @ 12.5 t ha-1. For the standing crop, less than 39.4 ppm of zinc in leaves, foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSo is 4 recommended. 4 Iron deficiency : Foliar spray of 1% FeSO + 0.1% citric acid on 30, 40 and 50 days 4 after sowing. Apply 50 kg FeSO + 12.5 t FYM basally. 4 Boron deficiency: Application of Borax 10 kg basally (or) 0.2% boric acid twice on 40, 50 DAS. For multinutrient deficiency: Apply 25 kg ZnSO + 10 kg borax + 20kg S", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Spray twice 4 4 after observing plant nutrient deficiencies. 7. SEED RATE Use 125 kg/ha of kernels. Increase the seed rate by 15% in the case of bold seeded varieties. 8. SPACING Adopt a spacing of 30 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants. Wherever groundnut ring mosaic (bud necrosis) is prevalent, adopt a spacing of 15cm x 15 cm. 9. SEED TREATMENT i) Treat the seeds with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed. Biocontrol agents are compatible with biofertilizers. First treat the seeds with biocontrol agents and then with Rhizobium. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible. ii) Treatment with Trichoderma can be done just before sowing. SUCH SEEDS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH FUNGICIDES. (or) iii) Treat the seeds with Thiram or Mancozeb @ 4 g/kg of seed or Carboxin or Carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seed. iv) Treat the seeds with 3 packets (600 g)/ha of Rhizobial culture TNAU14 developed at TNAU using rice kanji as binder. If the seed treatment is not carried out, apply 10 packets/ha (2000 g) with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of soil before sowing. Seed treatment will protect the young seedlings from root-rot and collar rot infection. 10. SOWING a) Dibble the seeds at 4 cm depth along with fertilizer. 11. WEED MANAGEMENT i. Pre-emergence: Pendimethalin @ 1.0 litre/ha applied on third day after sowing through flat fan nozzle with 500 litres of water/ha followed by irrigation. After 35 - 40 days one hand weeding may be given. ii. Spray Early post emergence application of Imazethapyr @ 50 ml/ha at 20-30 days after sowing based on weed density as post emergence spray iii.

EARTHING UP: Accomplish earthing up during second hand weeding/late hand weeding (in herbicide application). NOTE: i) Earthing up provides medium for the peg development. ii) Use the improved hoe with long handle which can be worked more efficiently in a standing position. iii) Do not disturb the soil after the 45th day of sowing as it will affect pod formation adversely. 13. APPLICATION OF CALCIUM SULPHATE (GYPSUM) (cid:131) Apply gypsum @ 400 kg/ha by the side of the plants on the 40th to 45th day of sowing. Apply gypsum, hoe and incorporate in the soil and then earth up. (cid:131) Avoid gypsum in calciferous soils. (cid:131) Gypsum is effective in soils deficient in calcium and sulphur. NOTE: Application of gypsum encourages pod formation and better filling up of the pods. Application of gypsum at the rate of 50 % basal both in rainfed and irrigated condition reduces Khadhasty malady and pod scab nematode Combined nutrient spray Pod filling is a major problem especially in the bold seed varieties. To improve pod filling spraying of nutrient solution is to be given. This can be prepared by soaking DAP 2.5 kg, Ammonium sulphate 1 kg and borax 0.5 kg in 37 lit of water overnight. The next day morning it can be filtered and about 32 litre of mixture can be obtained and it may be diluted with 468 lit of water so as to made up to 500 litre to spray for one ha. Planofix at the rate of 350 ml. can also be mixed while spraying. This can be sprayed on 25th and 35th day after sowing. or Spray TNAU Groundnut Rich @ 5.5 kg/ha for 2 sprays (50 per cent flowering and pod developing stage) to increase flower retention and pod filling. 14.

Regulate irrigation as per the growth phase of the crop. Pre-flowering phase : 1 to 25 days Flowering phase : 26 to 60 days Maturity phase: 61 to 105 days Regulate irrigation based on physiological growth phases. Pegging, flowering and pod development phases are critical for irrigation during which period adequate soil moisture is essential. Irrigate as follows: i) Sowing or pre-sowing ii) Life irrigation, 4 - 5 days after sowing. iii) 20 days after sowing iv) At flowering give two irrigations v) At pegging stage give one or two irrigations vi) In pod development stage, 2 - 3 irrigations depending on the soil type Note: Spraying 0.5% Potassium chloride during flowering and pod development stages 192 will aid to mitigate the ill effects of water stress. Sprinkler irrigation will save water to the tune of about 30%. Borderstrip irrigation is recommended in command areas in light textured soils. Composted coir pith increases moisture availability and better drainage in heavy textured soil. 15. HARVESTING i) Observe the crop, considering its average duration. Drying and falling of older leaves and yellowing of the top leaves indicate maturity. ii) Pull out a few plants at random and shell the pods. If the inner shell is brownish black and not white, then the crop has matured. iii) Irrigate prior to harvest, if the soil is dry, as this will facilitate easy harvesting. If there is enough moisture in the soil, there is no need for irrigation for harvesting. iv) If water is not available for irrigating the field prior to harvest, work a mould board plough or work a country plough, so that the plants are uprooted. Engage labour to search pods left out in the soil, if necessary. NOTE: Do not keep the pulled out plants in heaps when they are wet, especially the bunch varieties, as the pods will start sprouting. v) Strip off the pods from the plants. Groundnut stripper developed by TNAU can be used. vi) Dry the pods in the sun for 4 or 5 days. Repeat drying for 2 or 3 more days after an interval of 2 or 3 days to ensure complete drying.

SPACING a) Give a spacing of 30 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants. b) For rice fallows, seeds are broadcasted and thinned to maintain 11 plants/m2 7. QUALITY OF SEEDS Select mature, good quality seeds free from pest and fungal damage. 8. SEED TREATMENT Treat the seed with Trichoderma@ 4g/kg. This can be done just before sowing. SUCH SEEDS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH FUNGICIDES or treat the seed with Thiram 4 g or Carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seeds before sowing. 9. SOWING a) Sow the seeds preferably in lines. b) Mix the seeds with four times its volume of dry sand and drop the mixture evenly along the furrows in which fertilizers are applied. c) Sow the seeds to a depth of 3 cm and cover with soil. d) The optimum time of sowing for VRI (SV) 1 sesame is second fortnight of February to first fortnight of March under summer irrigated conditions. 10. WATER MANAGEMENT i) Irrigate at sowing and give life irrigation 7 days after sowing depending on the soil and climatic condition and allow excess water to percolate. ii) Give one pre-flowering irrigation (25 days): One at flowering and one or two at pod setting. An irrigation at flowering period is critical. NOTE: The critical stage for moisture requirement is the flowering phase i.e, between 35th to 45th days of sowing. During the maturity phase, moisture status should be low. If more water is given during this phase, maturity of seeds is affected and filling up of the capsules will be poor. Therefore, stop irrigation after 65 days of sowing. 11. THINNING Thin out the seedlings to a spacing of 15 cm between the plants on the 15th day of sowing and 30 cm on 30th day of sowing. This operation is very important for the crop in order to induce basal branches. 12. WEED MANAGEMENT i.

It grows best in areas where there are clear warm sunny days. Prolonged cloudy weather with high temperature at the time of flowering resulted in poor seed setting, which is known as sex reversion. High temperature above 41oC at flowering time even for as short period results in blasting of flowers. Very resistant to drought but evenly distributed rainfall is required. Heavy rainfall at flowering reduces the yield. Very susceptible to frost but grow even an altitudes of 1200 to 2100 m, if sown in March- April, perennial varieties are grown at still higher altitude for shade in coffee estates.

NIPPING For perennial castor variety YTP 1, nipping of primary shoot at 10th internode using secateurs is recommended for tripling the productive branches. 12. INTERCROPPING Raise one row of castor for every six rows of groundnut. In the case of late receipt of monsoon blackgram + castor at 6:1 ratio is recommended. Or Intercropping of castor with Blackgram or Greengram in 1:2 ratio is recommended for rainfed situation. Intercropping of castor with small onion in 1:2 ratio by adopting 1.5 m x 1.0 m spacing is recommended for irrigated situation. For hilly areas of Tamil Nadu viz., Kalrayan hills, Javadhu hills and Yelagiri hills, Samai (10kg/ha) + Castor 1.0 kg/ha) @ 10:1 ratio-line sowing (25cm x10 cm) with 50 % organic (FYM @ 8.0t/ha) and 50 % inorganic nutrient (22:11 kg N & P/ha) is recommended for realizing maximum profit. 13. HARVESTING THE CROP Observe the crop considering the average duration of the variety. i) One or more capsules show sign of drying. ii) Cut the matured racemes without damaging the secondaries. iii) Dry the capsule in the sun without heaping it in the shade. iv) Use castor sheller to separate the seeds or beat the dried capsule with wooden planks, winnow and collect the seeds. 210 For YRCH 1, first harvest has to be done on 90 DAS, subsequently second and third harvest is to be carried out on 120 and 150 DAS, respectively. For YRCH 2, first harvest has to be done on 110 DAS followed by second and third harvest is to be taken on 140 and 170 DAS, respectively.

FOLIAR SPRAY OF NAPHTHALENE ACETIC ACID (NAA) i) Foliar spray of Napthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) at 20 ppm concentration (280 g NAA in 625 litres of water per ha) on the 30th and 60th day of sowing. ii) Use a high volume sprayer and give a thorough coverage of the entire plant. iii) Do not use brackish water. 13. SULPHUR FERTILIZATION Apply sulphur @ 20 kg/ha through ammonium sulphate or single super phosphate. Or apply gypsum@ 200kg/ha as basal 14. BORIC ACID Foliar spray of boric acid @ 0.2 % (2g/l of water) to capitulum at ray floret opening stage to improve seed set and seed filling. 15. IMPROVING SEED SET BY MECHANICAL MEANS a. During the mid flowering phase, improve pollination by : i. Mild rubbing of the capitulum with the hand covered with soft cloth or ii. Rubbing two flowers face to face gently. iii. The mid-flowering phase are: 58 to 60 days of planting for long duration varieties, 45 to 48 days of planting for short duration varieties iv. .Do this operation in the morning hours between 9.0 and 11.00 am when pollen shedding is high. b. Keeping bee hives at the rate of 5/ha improves seed setting. 16. JUDGE WHEN TO HARVEST Observe the bracts on the backside of the capitula. When they turn lemon yellow, the heads harden and the crop is ready for harvest. Bird damage: Use of reflective ribbons scares the birds effectively and thus prevents loss of grain. 17. HARVESTING i. Cut the capitula (flower heads) only ii. Thresh and clean a. Immediately after harvest, dry the heads in the sun for 3 days. b. Spread the heads in thin layer and give turning once in 3 hours. NOTE: Do not heap or store the heads before drying properly as mould fungi will develop and spoil the grain quality. c.

By cutting and removal of these trees, the yield could be increased. Besides, there is saving in the cost of cultivation and increase in net profit. After removal of low yielding trees, the populations should be maintained at 175 palms/ha. ii. Ensuring adequate manuring and irrigation: The yield can be increased in the existing gardens when manuring + irrigation + cultural practice is adopted as per recommendation. Pencil point disorder (Micronutrient deficiency) Because of micronutrient deficiency, the stem will taper towards its tip with lesser number of leaves. The leaf size will be greatly reduced and the leaves will be pale and yellow in colour. Along with the recommended fertilizer dose, 225 g each of Borax, Zinc sulphate, Manganese sulphate, Ferrous sulphate, Copper sulphate and 10 g of Ammonium molybdate may be dissolved in 10 litres of water and poured in the basin of 1.8 m radius. This disorder can be corrected if noticed early. Severely affected palms may be removed and replanted with new seedlings. Button shedding Shedding of buttons and premature nuts may be due to any one of the following reasons: i) Excess acidity or alkalinity ii) Lack of drainage iii) Severe drought iv) Genetic causes v) Lack of nutrients vi) Lack of pollination 235 vii) Hormone deficiency viii) Pests ix) Diseases The following remedial measures are suggested. Rectification of soil pH Excess acidity or alkalinity of soil may cause button shedding. If the soil pH is less than 5.5, it is an indication of excess acidity. This could be rectified by adding lime. Increase in alkalinity is indicated by soil pH higher than 8.0. This situation could be rectified by adding gypsum. Providing adequate drainage facilities Lack of drainage results in the roots of coconut trees getting suffocated for want of aeration. Shedding of buttons occur under such condition. Drainage channels have to be dug along the contours to drain the excess water during rainy season. Management of young coconut gardens under waterlogged conditions (i) A trench between two rows of young coconut palms should be dug during onset of the monsoon rains.

Management of young coconut gardens under waterlogged conditions (i) A trench between two rows of young coconut palms should be dug during onset of the monsoon rains. The size of the trench is 3 m width, 30 \u2013 45 cm depth to entire length of field. The soil excavated from the trench should be placed along the rows of palms to make a raised bed. (ii) Form mound around the young palms to a radius of 1.2 m width with height of 30 \u201345 cm. Genetic causes In some trees button shedding may persist even after ensuring adequate manuring, irrigation and crop pest and disease management. This is an indication of inherent defect of the mother palm from which the seed material was obtained. This underlines the need for proper choice of superior mother palm for harvesting seed coconut to ensure uniformly good yielding trees. Lack of nutrition Button shedding occurs due to inadequate or lack of manuring. The recommended dose of manurial schedules and proper time of application are important to minimise the button shedding. Apply extra 2 kg of muriate of potash with 200 g of Borax/palm over and above the usual dosage of fertilizer to correct the barren nuts in coconut for period of 3 years. Boron deficiency or crown choke disorder Apply 200 g of borax/palm/year in two splits. Lack of pollination Button shedding also occurs due to lack of pollination. Setting up of beehives @ 15 units/ha may increase the cross pollination in the garden. Further the additional income obtained through honey, increases the net profit per unit area. 236 Hormone deficiency The fertilised female flowers i.e., buttons shed in some cases. By spraying 2, 4- D at 30 ppm or NAA 20 ppm (30 mg per litre of water) on the inflorescence one month after opening of the spathe, the setting percentage could be increased. Pests Button shedding may happen due to the attack of bug. Spraying of systemic insecticides like Methyldematon 0.025% (1ml/lit) or Dimethoate 0.03% (1ml/lit) may reduce the occurrence. Diseases Button shedding also occurs due to disease incidence such as basal stem rot.

Coconut mother palm selection and nursery management The need for collecting seed materials from high yielding coconut palms is highly essential in a perennial crop like coconut. The following points may be remembered. Mother palm selection 1. Select seed gardens, which contain large proportion of high yielding trees with uniformity in yielding ability. Trees growing closer to households, cattle shed, compost pits and other favorable conditions should be avoided. 2. High yielding mother palms giving not less than 100nuts/palm/annum should be chosen for collecting seednuts. Alternate bearers should be avoided. The age of the palm chosen be middle age i.e., from 25 to 40 years. Even trees with 15 years age can be selected, if it is high yielding and has stabilized yield. 3. The mother palm should have straight trunk, spherical or semi spherical crown, high rate of leaf and spathe production, short and stout petiole, more number of female flowers regular bearing habit, non \u2013 buckling bunches, high setting parentage, medium in nut size, high copra outturn and free from pest and diseases. A good regular bearing mother palm produces on an average one leaf and an inflorescence in its axil every month. So, there will be twelve bunches of varying stages of maturity at any one time. Avoid trees producing habitually barren nuts. 4. Harvest seednuts during the months of February - August to get maximum germination and good quality seedlings. Harvest the bunches intended for seednut by lowering them to the ground using a rope to avoid injury to seednuts 5. The seednuts should be round in shape and when tapped by finger should produce metallic sound. Fully ripe nuts develop twelve months after fertilisation. 6. To get more quality seedlings, the seednuts of tall and hybrid are to be air cured for one month followed by sand curing for two months. For dwarf varieties, the air curing should be lesser than one month followed by sand curing for two months. 237 Nursery management 1.

Five rows of nuts may be planted in each bed accommodating 50 nuts per row. 3. Irrigate the nursery beds once in three days. 4. Keep the nursery free of weeds. To manage the weed problem in coconut nursery, growing sunnhemp 2 times (each harvested at flowering stage) followed by one hand weeding at 6th month was found to be very effective besides yielding green manure for manuring the adult coconut palms. 5. Provide shade to the nursery by raising Sesbania or Leucaena on the sides of beds. 6. The seednuts start germination 6 \u2013 8 weeks after planting and germination continues upto six months. Select seedlings that germinate before 5 months after planting. Remove those nuts which do not germinate 5 months after sowing. 7. Regularly survey for pest and diseases 8. Select seedlings 9 to 12 months after planting. Seedlings, which have germinated earlier, having good girth at collar and early splitting of leaflets, should be selected for planting. Do not select the so called Kakkamukku Pillai i.e., seednuts which have just germinated. Eliminate the seedlings which are deformed or having stunted growth. 9. Remove the seedlings from the nursery by lifting with spade. Do not pull out the seedlings by pulling leaves or stem. 10. Select quality seedlings with a minimum of 6 leaves and girth of 10 cm at collar. 238 (vii) OILPALM CLIMATE REQUIREMENT Optimum T_MaxoC T_MinoC Rainfall mm Altitude m MSL oC 33 - 38 10 - 15 24 - 29 2000 \u2013 4000 up to 900 Tropical and subtropical climate.

{"id": "pdf_262", "text": "spell, a deep soil with high water holding capacity and a shallow water table augmented with copious irrigation will satisfy the water requirement of the palm. Temperature can be a limiting factor for oil palm production Best oil palm yields are obtained in places where a maximum average temperature of 29-33 C and minimum average temperature of 2-24 C are available. Higher diurnal temperature variation causes floral abortion in regions with a dry season. The crop requires 1800-2000 sunlight hours annually, more than 300 cal/cm2 / per day, constant sunlight of atleast 5 hours per day for better oil palm yield. Moist, deep and well drained medium textured soils rich in humus content are considered ideal. Gravelly and sandy soils, particularly the coastal sands are not ideal for oil palm cultivation. Heavy clay soils with poor drainage properties may pose problems of aeration during rainy seasons. NURSERY AND ITS MANAGEMENT Nursery is raised by planting germinated sprouts initially in a pre-nursery bed or in polybags in a primary nursery and transplanting them at five leaf stage to a secondary nursery of large sized polybags. Raising seedlings in large polybags without a pre-nursery stage is also being practiced. The potting mixture is made by mixing top soil, sand and well decomposed cattle manure in equal proportions. Smaller polybags of 250 guage and 23 x 13 cm size, preferably black are used for raising primary nurseries. These bags are filled with the potting mixture leaving one cm at the top of the bag. A healthy germinated sprout is placed at the centre at 2.5 cm depth. While placing the sprout, care must be taken to keep the plumule of the sprout facing upwards and the radicle downwards in the soil. It is better to plant sprouts soon after the differentiation of radicle and plumule. The seedlings are to be watered daily. Application of a fertilizer mixture containing one part of ammonium sulphate, one part of super phosphate, one part of muriate of potash and two parts of magnesium sulphate is recommended at 15 g at one month stage, 45 g at three months stage and 60 g at six months stage per seedling. This has to be applied 6 - 8 cm away from seedlings during the first application, 10-12 cm away during second and 15-20 cm away during the third application in primary nursery.

This has to be applied 6 - 8 cm away from seedlings during the first application, 10-12 cm away during second and 15-20 cm away during the third application in primary nursery. Surface soil is slightly scratched at the time of fertilizer application. 239 SINGLE STAGE POLY BAG NURSERY AND SECONDARY NURSERY The germinated seeds can be directly planted into large black polybags with the advantage of avoiding the pre-nursery stage. At present the single stage polybag nursery is recommended in India. Since the plants are to remain in these polybags for more than one year, good quality polybags of 500 gauge and 40 x 45 cm size are to be used. On the lower half of the bag, perforations are made at an interval of 7.5 cm for drainage. A bag can carry 15 - 18 kg of nursery soil depending on the type of soil mixture used. The water requirement for different stages of growth of seedlings are as follows: 0 - 2 months at 4 mm/day, 2 - 4 months at 5 mm/day, 4 - 6 months at 7 mm/day and 6 - 8 months at 10 mm/day. It is better to supply if feasible the daily requirement in two halves to prevent overflow and wastage caused by one time application. Application of 9 - 18 lit. of water per seedling per week according to the stage of growth and soil type. FIELD PLANTING Prepare the land for oil palm plantings at least 3 months before transplanting the seedlings to the main field. In soils with low permeability, drainage channels are to be constructed to prevent water stagnation in upper layer of soil AGE OF SEEDLINGS AT TRANSPLANTING It is advisable to plant well grown seedlings of 12 - 14 months old. At this stage, a well developed tenera seedling will have a height of 1-1.3 m from base and will have more than 13 functional leaves. These seedlings were found to maintain higher leaf production, bear earlier, produce heavy bunches, give higher fruit/bunch ratio and a higher oil to mesocarp in the first year of harvest. SELECTION OF SEEDLINGS All deformed, diseased and elongated seedlings are to be discarded. Differences in the height of healthy seedlings ranging from 90 to 159 cm tend to even up after 14 months of transplanting to maintain. TIME OF", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Differences in the height of healthy seedlings ranging from 90 to 159 cm tend to even up after 14 months of transplanting to maintain. TIME OF TRANSPLANTING Transplanting to the main field has to be done during the onset of rainy season. In very impermeable soils and where there is chance for the seedlings to suffer severely during rainy season, proper drainage has to be ensured. SPACING AND METHOD OF PLANTING The optimum planting density for oil palm is the density of population that gives maximum production from unit area. Triangular system of planting with 9 x 9 x 9 m spacing accommodates 143 palms/ha. is being recommended. For efficient utilization of solar energy the rows are to be oriented in the North-South direction. Equilateral triangular system of planting with 9 m spacing between palms will allow each plant to occupy the centre of a hexagon thus allowing better use of the area. 240 TRANSPORTING SEEDLINGS AND PREPARING PITS While transporting seedlings to the planting site one hand is placed at the bottom of the bag while holding the plant collar with the other one. Leather gloves can be used to avoid injury with spines of the leaves. Pits of 60 cm3 are taken prior to planting and filled with surrounding top soil and allowed to settle. Rock phosphate is applied at 200 g per planting pit. Nitrogen is not usually applied in the planting pits as the application of fertilizers may damage the root system and affect survival of the plants if there is a dry period soon after planting. Nitrogen and potassium are usually applied 4 \u2013 6 weeks after planting. In Mg deficient soils, magnesium is applied at 100 g as anhydrous MgSO or 200 g epsum salt per 4 seedling. REPLACEMENT AND GAP FILLING Field inspection is carried out one to two months after planting to gap fill dead plants. Replanting is carried out during the onset of next monsoon. These palms are to be given special care so that they can catch up with the rest of the plantations. Early production of more female inflorescences in the initial 30 months, is an indication of high yielders and all those that fail to produce female bunches will remain as poor yielders.

Early production of more female inflorescences in the initial 30 months, is an indication of high yielders and all those that fail to produce female bunches will remain as poor yielders. However, replacements are found to be affected to some extent by the vigorous growth of the neighbouring palms which will shade the replanted palms. FERTILIZER REQUIREMENT Based on the fertilizer experiments conducted under rainfed conditions in India, the following fertilizer schedule is recommended for oil palm until specific results are derived from multilocational fertilizer trials. Fertilizer recommendation for oilpalm Age Nutrients (gram/palm/year) N P K First year 400 200 400 Second year 800 400 800 Third year 1200 600 270 onwards 0 METHOD OF FERTILIZER APPLICATION The fertilizers are preferably applied in two equal split doses during May - June and September -October by uniformly spreading them within a 2 metre circle around the base of the palm and forking to incorporate them into the soil. Supply of sufficient quantity of green leaves or compost is advantageous especially where the soil is poor in organic matter content. Mg deficiency can be corrected through the application of 500 g of MgSO4 palm/year. Borax @ 100 g per palm also recommended. Urea is found to be the most economic nitrogen source if losses by volatilization and leaching are minimised. Rock phosphate and muriate of potash are the best source 241 for phosphorus and potassium respectively. During the initial years fertilizers may be applied within the area covered by the crown canopy. In the case of older palms, fertilizers are applied depending on the concentration of roots and are usually applied in the weeded circle. Appropriate soil conservation methods such as growing cover crops and platform cutting (on sloppy lands) enhance the efficiency of fertilizers by preventing losses through run off. NUTRIENTS - FUNCTIONS AND DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS The effect of major nutrients on growth and yield of oil palm has been studied in most of the oil palm growing countries in Asia and Africa. a) Nitrogen: In oil palm, characteristic yellowing symptoms are developed under N deficiency conditions.

{"id": "pdf_266", "text": "a) Nitrogen: In oil palm, characteristic yellowing symptoms are developed under N deficiency conditions. Nitrogen is found to be essential for rapid growth and fruiting of the palm. It increases the leaf production rate, leaf area, net assimilation rate, number of bunches and bunch weight. Excessive application of nitrogen increases the production of male inflorescence and decreases female inflorescence thereby reducing the sex ratio. b) Phosphorus: In oil palm seedlings, P deficiency causes the older leaves to become dull and assume a pale olive green colour while in adult palms high incidence of premature desiccation of older leaves occurs. Phosphorus application increases the bunch production rate, bunch weight, number of female inflorescences and thereby the sex ratio. However, lack of response to P due to P fixation in soils is very common in the tropics. Eventhough the main effect of phosphorus on the productivity of the palm has not been significant in most studies, it gives a positive interaction with nitrogen and potassium. c) Potassium: When potassium is deficient, growth as well as yield is retarded and it is translocated from mature leaves to growing points. Under severe deficiency, the mature leaves become chlorotic and necrotic. Confluent orange spotting is the main K deficiency condition in oil palm in which chlorotic spots, changing from pale green through yellow to orange, develop and enlarge both between and across the leaflet, veins and fuse to form compound lesions of a bright orange colour. Necrosis within spots is common, but irregular. Mid crown yellowing is another prominent K deficiency condition of the palm in which leaves around the 10th position on the phyllotaxy become pale in colour followed by terminal and marginal necrosis. A narrow band along the midrib usually remains green. There is a tendency for later formed leaves to become short and the palm has an unthrifty appearance with much premature withering. Potassium removal is large compared to the normal exchangeable K content in most top soils. It is mostly required for the production of more number of bunches, maximum number of female inflorescences, increased bunch weight and also for increasing the total dry matter production and yield. d) Magnesium: In adult oil palm and in seedlings in the field, severe Mg deficiency symptoms are most striking and have been named as \u2018orange frond\u2019.

While the lower most leaves are dead, those above them show a gradation of colouring 242 from bright orange on the lower leaves to faint yellow on leaves of young and intermediate age. The youngest leaves do not show any discolouration. The most typical Mg-deficiency symptom is the shading effect in which the shaded portion of the leaflet will be dark green while the exposed portion of the same leaflet is chlorotic. Heavy rates of K applications induce Mg-deficiency, particularly on poor acid soils. Among the secondary nutrients, calcium and sulphur, and probably chlorine, may not pose much problems to oilpalm cultivation in the country. e) Micronutrients: Micronutrient elements, iron, manganese, copper and zinc are not generally found limiting in the nutrition of oil palm on acid soil conditions. Boron deficiency is occasionally found on young palms in the field showing a reduction of leaf area in certain leaves producing incipient \u2018little leaf\u2019, advanced \u2018little leaf\u2019 with extreme reduction of leaf area and bunching and reduction in the number of leaflets and \u2018fish-bone\u2019 leaf. The \u2018fish-bone\u2019 leaves are abnormally stiff with leaflets reduced to projections. Leaf malformations including \u2018hook leaf\u2019 and corrugated leaflets are some other associated symptoms. Soil application of 50 - 200 g borax, per palm, depending on age, and severity of symptoms is practiced for correcting the malady. WATER REQUIREMENT Continuous soil moisture availability encourages vigorous growth and increased yield of oil palm. Adequate supply of water, good soil depth and water holding capacity contribute to water availability. In oil palm as water deficiency increases, stomata will remain closed and the development and opening of spear will be inhibited. Water deficiency adversely affects flower initiation, sex differentiation and therefore, results in low sex ratio due to production of more male inflorescences. It is established that oil palm needs 120 - 150 mm of water to meet its monthly evapo-transpiration needs. In areas where perennial water source is available, basin irrigation is possible. But where the terrain is undulating and water is scarce during summer months, drip irrigation is recommended to keep four drippers per palm in the weeded palm circle to supply atleast 90 litres of water per palm per day during summer months", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

But where the terrain is undulating and water is scarce during summer months, drip irrigation is recommended to keep four drippers per palm in the weeded palm circle to supply atleast 90 litres of water per palm per day during summer months which will vary according to the ETP values in a locality. FERTIGATION Drip fertigation with the recommended dose of fertilsers at bimonthly interval was found to increase the yield. WEED CONTROL The basin area of oil palm is kept free of weed growth through ring weeding. It is more important for young palms, roots of which are to be kept free from competition from weed. Depending on the extent of weed growth and rainfall, hand weeding is carried out even upto four times in a year during early years of the plantation which is progressively reduced to two rounds a year. Herbicide application has become common in recent years. Care must be taken in the choice of herbicide and its application to prevent the damage of young palms. It is recommended to preferably apply contact herbicides rather than translocated herbicides. Translocated herbicides like Paraquat which is inactivated when contacted with soil are also used. Herbicides such as 2, 4-D, 2, 4- 5-T, halogenated aliphatic acids Dalapon and TCA are found to produce abnormalities in oil palm seedlings and are to be 243 avoided. Pre-emrergence Atrazine @ 1.0 kg/ha for the control of grasses and sedges and POE Paraquat 10 ml / litre of water. MAINTENANCE OF PATHS In young plantation, the maintenance of paths is important for inspection and in later years for harvesting. This is carried out by timely weed control as done in the case of ring weeding. ABLATION The bunches produced initially will be very small and have low oil content. Removal of such inflorescences is called ablation or castration. Removal of all inflorescences during the initial three years is found to improve vegetative growth of young palms so that regular harvesting can commence after three and half years of planting. Ablation is done at monthly interval by pulling out the young inflorescence using gloves or with the help of devices such as narrow bladed chisels. Ablation improves drought resistance capacity of young palms by improving shoot and root growth especially in low production areas where dry condition exists.

Ablation improves drought resistance capacity of young palms by improving shoot and root growth especially in low production areas where dry condition exists. PRUNING OF LEAVES In oil palm two leaves are produced per month. Therefore, it becomes necessary to prune excess leaves so as to gain access to bunches for harvest. Severe pruning will adversely affect both growth and yield of palm, cause abortion of female flowers and also reduce the size of the leaves. It was suggested that palms aged 4 - 7 years should retain 6 - 7 leaves per spiral (48 - 56), those aged 8 - 14 years 5 - 6 leaves per spiral (40 - 49) and those above 15 years should have 4 - 5 leaves per spiral (32 - 40). Leaf pruning is carried out in India using chisels so that leaf base that is retained on the palm is as short as possible or otherwise it may catch loose fruits, allow growth of epiphytes and the leaf axils form a potential site for pathogens. The leaf petioles are removed by giving a clear cut at a sufficient distance from the base of the petiole using a sharp chisel for young palms and with the long sickle in taller palms. Pruning is preferably carried out at the end of the rainy season. It is also better to carry it out during the low crop season when labourers are also available. Pruning is confined to only lower senile leaves during initial harvests but when canopy closes in later years, leaves are cut so as to retain two whorls of fronds below the ripe bunch. Insect pollination in oil palm The oil palm, hitherto though to be wind pollinated, has been now proved to be an a insect pollinated species. From West Africa, the original home of oil palm, eight species of pollinating weevils were reported. Occurence of Eldeidobius kamerunicus in the oil palm plantations of Kerala was introduced during 1985 from where it was introduced and got established in little Andamans during 1986.

The activity of the insects is in accordance with the receptivity of the male and female inflorescences. 244 It was roughly estimated that 40 palms in a grove might be the minimum to sustain a sufficiently high continuous population of pollinators to pollinate. All are receptive female inflorescences. The weevils carry maximum pollen during the third day of antheses. Antennae, rostrum, thorax, legs etc. are the main sites of pollen land. E.kamerunicushas a fairly good searching ability. It can survive in dry as well as in wet seasons. Introduction of weevil in India increased the fruit let from 36.8 percent to 56.1 percent resulting in 40 per cent increase in F/B ratio. The maximum attainable pollination potential was as much as to cent percent with 57 percent increase in FFB weight. For introduction, male flowers cut from palms which have the weevils are transferred to a plantation where one wishes to introduce. In order to make sure that they are not carrying any plant pathogens to other area/countries, we have to breed them under laboratory conditions for seven or eight generations before introduction. Pest Management In India, since the import of germplasm is in the form of seeds/sprouts, possibilities for introduction of the pest species from other countries are limited. But many of the pest species of related palm species such as coconut and areca palm, have got adapted to oil palm. Among the 49 species of insects infesting adult oilpalms, 14 species are known pests of coconut and 19 species are known pests of areca palms. Insect pests of oilpalm in India are more or less same as those reported from Malaysia and other South-East Asian countries. PEST OF ADULT PALMS The rhinoceros beetle The rhinoceros beetle is primarily a serious pest of coconut palm, and in recent years has attained the pest status in oilpalm also.

Damage is due to the feeding activity of the grubs, usually 12-87 per palm, which bore through and feed on the softer tissues of stem and meristem. Palms infested by R.ferrugineus show gradual wilting and drying of outer whorl of fronds. In some cases roofing of spear was also noticed. Biological control In nature, the rhinoceros beetle is suppressed by entomophogens like Baculovirus oryctusvirus and Metarhizium anisopliae. Release of Baculovirusoryctes minimise the pest incidence. 245 Cultural control i) Field sanitation and elimination of breeding sites like dead palm trunks, empty bunch heaps etc., within the plantations are essential for the management of both red palm weevil and rhinoceros beetle. ii) When the infestation by rhinoceros beetle is very high, especially in young plantations, Hand picking of the adult beetles using hooks is very effective. iii) For red palm weevils, use of attractants incorporating fermented sugarcane juice, acetic acid, yeast etc., to collect and kill the adult weevils is recommended. Chemical control i) For rhinoceros beetles, placing 3-4 napthalene balls in the youngest spear axils at weekly intervals is recommended. ii) For palms with advanced stage of infestation by red palm weevil, stem injection of 5-8 ml of monocrotophos is advised. Fruit bunch covering against avian pests Covering the bunches with different materials such as noirenets, reed baskets, plaited coconut leaf baskets and senile oil palm leaf are effective in preventing the fruit damage. But senile oil palm leaf covering is more practical and economical as the material is readily available and involves only the labour charges and cost of rope bits. Rodent control Among rats, the burrowing type is more serious which tunnel into the bole of the seedlings. Different baits such as acute poison baits (Zinc phosphide, Aluminium phosphide etc.) anticoagulants (warfarin, fumarin, bromadiolone) and traps such as iron like traps, snap traps, deathfall trap, boro trap etc. may be used as an integrated approach to minimise the rodent", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Disease Oil palm, a new crop to the country is reported to be affected by a number of diseases and disorders. Among these, bud rot causes considerable economic losses. Bud rot \u2022 Higher disease incidence is noticed in young plantations. Rotting initiates at the basal portion of the spear closure to the meristem and extends to the whole spear. The spear could be easily pulled off. \u2022 Cleaning the affected tissues and drenching the crown with carbendazim 0.1 percent cures the disease. \u2022 The leaves emerging immediately after the application of fungicides are shorter and successively emerging ones are normal. Leaf spots \u2022 Leaf spots caused by Curvularia noticed on the inner whirl and young leaves. The fungal spots enlarge with a yellow ring around spots. As these spots enlarge the leaf will be scorched. \u2022 Pestalotiopsis fungal spots are irregular with grey to brown centre. Numerous black dots, the acervuli of the fungus, are seen on the lesions. 246 Management Affected leaves must be cut and burnt Spray Mancozeb @ 0.2%. HARVESTING Proper and timely harvesting of fruit bunches is an important operation which determines the quality of oil to a great extent. The yield is expressed as fresh fruit bunches (FFB) in kg per hectare per year or as oil per hectare per year. The bunches usually ripen in six months after anthesis. Unripe fruits contain high water and carbohydrate and very little oil. As the fruit ripens oil content increase to 80 - 85% in mesocarp. Over ripe fruit contains more free fatty acids (FFA) due to decomposition and thus increases the acidity. Usually the ripe fruits, attached to the bunches contain 0.2 to 0.9% FFA and when it comes out of extraction plant the FFA content is above 3%.Ripeness of the fruit is determined by the degree of detachment of the fruit from bunches, change in colour and change in texture of the fruit. Ripening of fruits start from top downwards, nigrescens fruits turning reddish orange and the virescens (green) to reddish brown. Fruits also get detached from tip downward in 11", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}
{"id": "pdf_273", "text": "is determined by the degree of detachment of the fruit from bunches, change in colour and change in texture of the fruit. Ripening of fruits start from top downwards, nigrescens fruits turning reddish orange and the virescens (green) to reddish brown. Fruits also get detached from tip downward in 11 - 20 days time. Ripeness is faster in young palms than in older palms for the bunches of equal weight. The criteria used in determining the degree of ripeness based on the fruit detachment are as follows: a) fallen fruits: 10 detached or easily removable fruits for young palms and 5 for adult palms, b) number of fruits detached after the bunch is cut; 5 or more fruits/kg of bunch weight, c) quantity of detachment per bunch; fruit detachment on 25% of visible surface of bunch. These criteria could be applied with flexibility. FREQUENCY OF HARVESTING Harvesting rounds should be made as frequent as possible to avoid over ripening of bunches. A bunch which is almost ripe but not ready for harvest for a particular harvesting round should not be over-ripe by next round. In lean period of production, harvesting can be made less frequent and it should be more frequent in peak periods. Harvesting rounds of 7 - 14 days are generally practiced. Other factors determining frequency are, extraction capacity of the mill, transportation facilities, labour availability and skill of the workers. In India, harvesting is usually carried out with a chisel of 6 - 9 cm wide attached to a wooden pole or light hollow aluminium pipe, Bunches are cut without damaging the petiole the leaf that supports it. Use of narrow chisel is usually carried out till the palm reaches two meters above the ground. For taller palms upto 4 meters, a wider chisel of 14 cm is used. The curved knife is attached to a long bamboo or aluminium pole with screws or steel wires to harvest from taller palms. In uneven stands, an adjustable, telescopic type of pole is in use. 247 Yield of Oilpalm In well maintained garden the yield of oilpalm will be as furnished below : Age of oilpalm Yield Ton/ha/year 3-4 years 5 4-5 years 12 5-6 years 25 6-25 years 30 ECONOMICS A detailed account of the economics of oilpalm cultivation in India has been furnished.

This excludes the cost of land as we expect government owned land, leased land, or already owned property will be used for oilpalm cultivation. From the fourth year, the yield of bunches increases upto tenth year, and a stabilized bearing is attained thereafter. The investment during first year under irrigation will be almost three times of that under rainfed conditions mainly on account of the initial expenditure required to install the drip irrigation system. With irrigation the annual returns will exceed the annual expenses from the first harvest itself, i.e, during the fourth year after planting. By the end of sixth year the total returns will be more than total investments including all the expenditure for installing pumpset and the drip irrigation system.

In one operation, placement of fertilizer, sowing of seeds and covering will be completed. NOTE: Cotton and pulses can be sown at a depth of 5 cm in black cotton soil even before the onset of monsoon rains in dry bed sowing. When light rains are received, the moisture will not penetrate deeper and the seeds will not germinate and die away. Only when good rains are received, the moisture level will be sufficient to penetrate to the level of the seed and facilitate germination and proper establishment. 3.2.10. WEED MANAGEMENT xvi) Pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin (38.7% CS) 650 ml/ha followed by one hand weeding on 40 days after crop emergence.

Fluchloralin can be sprayed at 3 days after sowing at the rate of 1.5 kg per hectare and is followed by irrigation. Further one hand weeding can be taken up at 30 - 35 DAS. Top dressing of fertiliser: Apply 10 kg of N at 20 - 25 days after first weeding and then again on 35 - 40 days after second weeding as top dressing. During periods of drought and fertilizer shortage, spray 8 kg of urea as 2 per cent urea solution (20 g urea in one litre of water) on jute foliage on 40 - 45 as well as 70 - 75 DAS. Water Management: Jute crop requires 500 mm of water. First irrigation is to be given after sowing and life irrigation on fourth day after sowing. Afterwards irrigation can be given once in 15 days. Harvest: Jute crop can be harvested from 100 to 110 DAS but can be extended from 120 - 135 DAS depending on local cropping systems. Jute plants are left in the field for 3 - 4 days for leaf shedding. Then thick and thin plants are sorted out and bundled in convenient size.

PREPARATION OF THE FIELD a) Wetland (Heavy soils): In wetlands, preparatory cultivation by ploughing the land and bringing the soil to fine tilth could not be done. i. After harvest of the paddy crop, form irrigation and drainage channels of 40 cm depth and 30 cm width at intervals of 6 m across the field and along the field borders. ii. Form ridges and furrows with a spacing of 80 cm between rows with spade. iii. Stir the furrows with hand hoes and allow the soil to weather for 4 to 5 days. b) Problem soils with excessive soil moisture: In problem soils, with excessive moisture where it is difficult to drain water, form raised beds at 30 cm intervals with Length - 5 m, Width - 80 cm, and Height -15 cm. c. Garden lands with medium and light soils: In medium and light soil irrigated by flow or lift irrigation adopt the following: i. The initial ploughing with two disc plough followed by eight disc plough and using cultivator for deep ploughing followed by one time operation of rotovator to pulverize the soil to get a fine tilth, free of weeds and stubbles. ii. Level the field with laser leveler for effective and proper irrigation management. iii. Open ridges and furrows with tractor operated victory plough with a depth of 30cm and spacing of 80 cm between the rows for normal planting with furrow irrigation. iv. Open irrigation channels at 10 m intervals. 2. BASAL APPLICATION OF ORGANIC MANURES: Apply FYM at 12.5 t/ha", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Open ridges and furrows with tractor operated victory plough with a depth of 30cm and spacing of 80 cm between the rows for normal planting with furrow irrigation. iv. Open irrigation channels at 10 m intervals. 2. BASAL APPLICATION OF ORGANIC MANURES: Apply FYM at 12.5 t/ha or compost 25 t/ha or filter press mud at 37.5 t/ha before the last ploughing under gardenland conditions. In wetlands this may be applied along the furrows and incorporated well. Preparation of reinforced compost from sugarcane trash and pressmud: Spread the sugarcane trash to a thickness of 15 cm over an area of 7 m x 3 m. Then apply pressmud over this trash to a thickness of 5 cm. Sprinkle the fertilizer mixture containing mussoorie rock phosphate, gypsum and urea in the ratio of 2:2:1 over these layers at the rate of 5 kg/100 kg of trash. Moist the trash and pressmud layers adequately with water. Repeat this process till the entire heap rises to a height of 1.5 m. Use cowdung slurry instead of water to moist the layer wherever it is available. Cover the heap with a layer of soil and pressmud at 1:1 ratio to a thickness 289 of 15 cm. Leave the heap as such for three months for decomposition. Moist the heap once in 15 days. During rainy season, avoid moistening the heap. After three months, turn and mix the heap thoroughly and form a heap and leave it for one more month. Then turn and mix the heap thoroughly at the end of the fourth month. Moist the heap once in 15 days during 4th and 5th month also. This method increases the manurial value of trash compost by increasing, N, P and Ca content. It also brings down the C:N ratio by 10 times as compared to raw cane trash.

Subsurface application: Application of 255 kg of Nitrogen in the form of urea along with potash at 10cm depth with 15cm intervals by the side of the cane clump will result in the saving of 20 kg N/ha without any yield reduction. Nutritional Disorders : Nitrogen deficiency : All leaves of sugarcane exhibit a yellow \u2013 green colour and retardation of growth. Cane stalks are smaller in diameter and premature drying of older leaves. Roots attain a greater length but are smaller in diameter. Phosphorus deficiency : Reduction in length of sugarcane stalks, diameters of which taper rapidly at growing points. The colour of the leaves is greenish blue, narrow and some what reduce length. Reduced tillering, decreased shoot / root ratio with restricted root development. Potassium deficiency: Depressed growth, yellowing and marginal drying of older leaves and development of slender stalks. An orange, yellow colour appears in the older lower leaves which develop numerous chlorotic spots that later become brown with dead centre. A reddish discoloration which is confined to the epidermal cells of the upper surfaces and midribs of the leaves. The young leaves appear to have developed from a common point giving a \u201cBunched top\u201d appearance. Poor root growth with less member of root hairs. Zinc deficiency: Mild zinc deficiency exhibit a tendency to develop anthrocyanin pigments in the leaves. Pronounced bleaching of the green colour along the major veins and also striped effect due to a loss of chlorophyll along the veins. In acute cases of zinc deficiency there is evidences of necrosis and growth ceases at the growing point (meristem). Iron deficiency: Symptoms of Iron deficiency are generally seen in young leaves where pale stripes with scanty chlorophyll content occur between parallel lines. In advanced stages of deficiency the young leaves turn completely white, even in the veins. Root growth also becomes restricted. Boron deficiency : Boron deficiency could be seen in the cane by depressed growth,", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

In advanced stages of deficiency the young leaves turn completely white, even in the veins. Root growth also becomes restricted. Boron deficiency : Boron deficiency could be seen in the cane by depressed growth, development of distorted and chlorotic leaves and the presence of definite leaf and stalks lesions. In extreme cases of boron deficiency the plant will die. Importance of Balanced Nutrition The soil fertility has declined in many sugarcane growing areas of the state due to improper and some times, distorted fertilizer schedules adopted over the years under intensive cultivation of the crop. Hence balanced application of fertilizer based on soil test values and crop requirement is essential. 295 How to Evaluate fertilizer requirement Through STCR fertilizer prescription equations a.

BIOFERTILIZER FOR SUGARCANE Azospirillum is the common biofertilizer recommended for N nutrition which could colonize the roots of sugarcane and fix atmospheric nitrogen to the tune of about 50 to 75 kg nitrogen per ha per year. Recently, another endophytic nitrogen fixing bacterium, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus isolated from sugarcane can able to fix more nitrogen than Azospirillum. It colonizes throughout the sugarcane and increases the total N content. In soil, it can also colonize the roots and able to solubilize the phosphate, iron and Zn. It can also enhance the crop growth, yield of sugarcane and sugar content of the juice. Since it is more efficient than Azospirillum, this new organism was test-verified in various centres and released as new biofertilizer Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus TNAU Biofert-I. Phosphobacteria as P solubiliser are recommended for sugarcane crop. 296 Sett treatment with Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Before planting the sugarcane setts can be treated with ten packets (2 kg) per ha of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus prepared as slurry with 250 L of water.

WATER MANAGEMENT Irrigate the crop depending upon the need during different phases of the crop. Germination phase (0 - 35 days): Provide shallow wetting with 2 to 3 cm depth of water at shorter intervals especially for sandy soil for enhancing the germination. Sprinkler irrigation is the suitable method to satisfy the requirement, during initial stages. Later, irrigation can be provided at 0.75, 0.75 and 0.50 IW/CPE ratio during tillering, grandgrowth and maturity phases respectively. The irrigation intervals in each phase are given below: Days of irrigation interval Stages Tillering phase (36 to 100 days) 8 10 Grand growth phase (101 - 270 8 10 days) Maturity phase (271 - harvest) 10 14 Drip Irrigation: o Planting setts obtained from 6-7 months old healthy nursery and planted in paired row planting system with the spacing of 30x30x30 / 150 cm. for manual harvest and 30/150 cm for machine harvest o Eight setts per metre per row have to be planted on either sides of the ridge thus making it as four row planting system. o 12 mm drip laterals have to be placed in the middle ridge of each furrow with the lateral spacing of 240 cm & 8 \u2018Lph\u2019 clog free drippers should be placed with a spacing of 75 cm on the lateral lines. The lateral length should not exceed more than 30-40 m. o Phosphorus @ 62.5 kg ha-1 has to be applied as basal at the time of planting. o Nitrogen and Potassium @ 275:112.5 kg ha-1 have to be injected into the system as urea and muriate of potash by using \u201cVentury\u201d assembly in 10-12 297 equal splits starting from 15 to 150- 180 days after planting. o Low or medium in nutrient status soil to be given with 50 per", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Concept of fertigation - Fertigation is the judicious application of fertilizers by combining with irrigation water. - Fertigation can be achieved through fertilizer tank, venturi System, Injector Pump, Non- Electric Proportional Liquid Dispenser (NEPLD) and Automated system. - Recommended N & K @ of 275 and 112.5 kg. ha-1 may be applied in 14 equal splits with 15 days interval from 15 DAP. - 25 kg N and 8 kg K 2 O per ha per split. - Urea and MOP (white potash) fertilisers can be used as N and K sources respectively - Fertigation up to 210 DAP can also be recommended. Advantages of Fertigation - Ensures a regular flow of water as well as nutrients resulting in increased growth rates for higher yields - Offers greater versatility in the timing of the nutrient application to meet specific crop demands - Improves availability of nutrients and their uptake by the roots - Safer application method which eliminates the danger of burning the plant root system - Offers simpler and more convenient application than soil application of fertilizer thus saving time, labour, equipment and energy - Improves fertilizer use efficiency - Reduction of soil compaction and mechanical damage to the crops - Potential reduction of environmental contamination - Convenient use of compound and ready-mix nutrient solutions containing also small concentration of micronutrients. 15.

Spray Sodium metasilicate 4 kg/ha in 750 litres of water on the foliage of crop at 6 months after planting. ii. Repeat the same twice at 8th and 10th months to obtain higher cane yield and sugar percentage. b. Assessing maturity of crops i. Assess the maturity by hand refractometer brix survey and 18 to 20 per cent brix indicates optimum maturity for harvest. ii. Top-bottom ratio of H.R.Brix reading should be 1:1. 18. HARVESTING i. Early varieties have to be harvested at 10 to 11 months age and mid-season varieties at 11 to 12 months age. ii. Harvest the cane at peak maturity. Cut the cane to the ground level for both plant and ratoon crops. B. RATOON CROP I. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIELD AFTER HARVEST OF THE PLANT CROP Complete the following operations within 10 days of harvest of plant crop to obtain better establishment and uniform sprouting of shoots. 1. Remove the trash from the field. Do not burn it. Irrigate the field copiously. 2. Follow stubble shaving with sharp spades to a depth of 4 - 6 cm along the ridges at proper moisture. 302 3. Work with cooper plough along with sides of the ridges to break the compaction. 4. The gappy areas in the ratoon sugarcane crop should be filled within 30 days of stubble shaving. The sprouted cane stubbles taken from the same field is the best material for full establishment. The next best method is gap filling with seedlings raised in polybags. 5. Apply basal dose of organic manure and super phosphate as recommended for plant crop. II. MANAGEMENT OF THE CROP 1. 25% additional N application on 5-7 days after ratooning. 2.

Foliar spray of Ferrous sulphate at 2.5 kg/ha on the 15th day. If chlorotic condition persists, repeat the spray twice further at 15 days interval. Add urea 2.5 kg/ha in the last spray. 3. Hoeing and weeding on 20th day and 40th to 50th day. 4. First top dressing on 25th day, 2nd on 45th to 50th day. 5. Final manuring on 70th to 75th day. 6. Partial earthing up on 50th day. If junior-hoe is worked two or three times upto 90th day, partial earthing up is not necessary. 7. Final earthing up on 90th day. 8. Detrashing on 120th and 180th day. 9. Trash twist propping on 180th day. 10. Harvest after 11 months. C. SHORT CROP (NURSERY CROP) SELECTION OF PROPER PLANTING MONTHS FOR RAISING NURSERY CROP IN RELATION TO MAIN FIELD PLANTING Raise six to seven months old nursery crop prior to main field planting as follows: Raise nursery crop during Main field planting June December - January (early season) July February - March (Mid season) August April - May (Late season) Dec - Apr June - September (Special season) II. PRECAUTIONS IN MAINTAINING NURSERY CROP Adopt similar production techniques for raising short crop with the following modifications. 1. Do not detrash 2. Do not prop 3. Harvest at 6 to 7 months age 4. Remove trash by hand while preparing setts 5. Avoid bud damage 6. Transport the seed material to other places in the forms of full canes with trash intact. 7. Apply 50 kg of urea as top dressing additionally before one month of cutting the seed cane. 303 CROP PHYSIOLOGY Foliar spray of TNAU Sugarcane Booster @ 1.0, 1.5 and 2 kg/acre in 200 litres of water at 45,60 and 75 days after planting enhances cane growth and weight, internodal length, cane yield, sugar content and offers drought tolerance.

TROPICAL SUGARBEET PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY Introduction Tropical sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris spp. Vulgaris var altissima Doll) is a biennial sugar producing tuber crop, grown in temperate countries. This crop constitutes 30% of total world production and distributed in 45 countries. Now tropical sugarbeet hybrids are gaining momentum in tropical and sub tropical countries including Tamil Nadu as a promising energy crop and alternative raw materials for the production of ethanol. Apart from sugar production, the value added products like ethanol can also be extracted from sugarbeet. The ethanol can be blended with petrol or diesel to the extent of 10% and used as bio-fuel. The sugarbeet waste material viz., beet top used as green fodder, beet pulp used as cattle feed and filter cake from industry used as organic manure. Tropical sugarbeet now emerged as commercial field crop because of the favourable characters like (i) tropical sugarbeet hybrids suitable for Tamil Nadu (ii) Shorter duration of 5 to 6 months (iii) needs moderate water requirement of 60-80 cm. (iv) higher sugar content of 12 \u2013 15% (v) improve soil conditions because of tuber crop and (vi) grow well in saline and alkali soil. The harvesting period of sugarbeet coincides with March \u2013 June, the human resource of sugar factory in the off season may efficiently utilized for processing of sugarbeet in the sugar mills, which helps in continuous functioning of sugar mills. Hybrids and duration The tropical sugarbeet hybrids suitable for cultivation in Tamil Nadu are Cauvery, Indus and Shubhra. The duration of these tropical hybrids will be 5 to 6 months depending on climatic conditions prevailing during crop growth period.

The duration of these tropical hybrids will be 5 to 6 months depending on climatic conditions prevailing during crop growth period. Climate and season Tropical sugarbeet require good sunshine during its growth period. The crop does not prefer high rainfall as high soil moisture or continuous heavy rain may affect development of tuber and sugar synthesis. Tropical sugarbeet can be sown in September\u2013 November coincide with North East monsoon with a rainfall of 300 \u2013 350 mm well distributed across the growing period which favours vegetative growth and base for root enlargement. The optimum temperature for germination is 20 \u2013 250C, for growth and development 30 - 350C and for sugar accumulation in 25\u2013 350C. Season Tropical sugarbeet is sown in September to November and harvested during March and May. Field preparation Well drained sandy loam and clayey loam soils having medium depth (45\u201d cm) with fairly good organic status are suitable. Tropical sugarbeet require deep ploughing (45 cm) and followed by 2 \u2013 3 ploughing to obtain a good soil tilth condition for favorable seed germination. Ridges and furrows are formed at 50 cm apart. 311 Manures and Fertilizers S.No Manures and Fertilizers Basal Application Top dressing 1 Manures 12.5 tonnes /ha - 2 Biofertilizers 2 kg /acre (10 pockets) Azospirillum Phosphobacteria 2 kg /acre (10 pockets) - 3.

The earthing up operations coincides with top dressing of N fertilizer. Irrigation Tropical sugarbeet is very sensitive to water stagnation in soil at all stages of crop growth. Irrigation should be based on soil type and climatic condition. Pre-sowing irrigation is essential since at the time of sowing, sufficient soil moisture is must for proper irrigation. First irrigation is crucial for the early establishment of the crop. For loose textured sandy loam soil irrigation once in 5 to 7 days and for heavy textured clay loam soil once in 8 \u2013 10 days is recommended. The irrigation has to be stopped at least 2 to 3 weeks before harvest. At the time of harvest, if the soil is too dry and hard it is necessary to give pre harvest irrigation for easy harvest. Light and frequent irrigation is recommended for maintaining optimum soil moisture. Water requirement is 800 - 850 mm.

No insecticide is registered/label claimed against the pests of fodder crops. 8. Harvesting Plant can be harvested as short as 6 months after planting. However, the initial cutting should not be done until the trunk has attained at least 3 cm diameter or the plant has completed one seed production cycle. Harvests can be repeated once in 40 - 80 days depending upon growth and season. In drought prone areas, allow the trees to grow for two years to ensure deep root penetration before commencing harvest. The trees can be cut at 90 to 100 cm height from ground level. For poles and fuel, allow the tree to grow straight without cutting for 2.5 or 5 years as the case may be. 9. Green fodder yield As green fodder under irrigated conditions, a pure crop yields about 80 to 110 t/ha of green fodder.

MUSHROOM CULTIVATION Agriculture will continue to be the main strength of Indian economy. With the variety of agricultural crops grown today, we have achieved food security by prodding about 240 million tonnes of food grains. However, our struggle to achieve nutritional security is still on. In future, the ever increasing population, depleting agricultural land, changes in environment, water shortage and need for quality food products at competitive rates are going to be the vital issues and secondary agricultural vocations are going to occupy a prominent place to fill the void quality food requirements. The demand for quality food and novel products is increasing with the changes in life style and income. To meet these challenges and to provide food and nutritional security to our people, it is important to diversify the agricultural activities in areas like horticulture. Diversification in any farming systems imparts sustainability. Mushrooms are one such component that not only impart diversification but also help in addressing the problems of quality food, health and environmental sustainability.

The present century is going to be a century of functional foods from synthetic chemicals and mushroom cultivation fits very well into this category and is going to be an important vocation. Mushrooms represent microbial technology that recycles agricultural residues into food and manure. It is solid state fermentation system in which crop residues are converted into valuable food rich in microbial protein. These are important source of quality protein, minerals and various novel compounds of medicinal value, do not compare for land and have very high productivity per unit area and time. These are considered to be the highest protein per unit area and time due to utilization of vertical space and short crop cycle. Due to their cultivation under controlled conditions the water requirements is less than any other crop grown in the field and has all the potentials of being a major crop in coming years. Mushroom farming today is being practiced in more than 100 countries and its production is increasing at an annual rate of 6-7%. In some developed countries of Europe and America, mushroom farming has attained the status of a high-tech industry with very high levels of mechanization and automation. China leads in mushroom production and China alone is reported to grow more than 20 different types of mushroom at commercial scale and mushroom cultivation has become China\u2019s sixth largest industry. The USA is the second largest producer of mushroom sharing 16% of the world output. Presently, three geographical regions- Europe, America and East Asia contribute to about 96% of world mushroom production. With the rise in the income level, the demand for mushrooms at very low costs with the help of seasonal growing, state subsidies and capturing the potential markets in the world with processed mushrooms at costs not remunerative to the growers in other mushroom producing countries. Commercial production of edible mushrooms represents unique exploitation of the microbial technology for the bio conversion of the agricultural, industrial, forestry and household waste into nutritious and proteinaceous food.

Integrating mushroom cultivation in the existing farming systems will not only supplement the income of the farmers but also will promote proper recycling of agro-residues thereby improving soil health and promoting organic agriculture. In India, mushroom research started in1960s and the cultivation picked up in 1970s and new varieties were evolved in button and oyster mushroom during 1980s and 1990s. Since the year 2000, our country is progressing keeping in pace with global growth by developing technologies for cultivation of medicinal mushrooms. India has varied agro-climate, abundance of agricultural residues and plenty of manpower making it suitable for cultivating different mushrooms. Our country produces about 600 million tonnes of agricultural waste per annum and a major part of it is let out to decompose naturally or burnt in situ. This can effectively be utilized to produce highly nutritive food such as mushrooms and spent mushroom substrate can be converted into organic manure and vermi-compost. Mushrooms are grown seasonally as well as in state-of- art environment controlled cropping rooms all the year round in the commercial units. Mushroom growing is a highly labour oriented venture and labour availability is no constraint in the country and two factors, that is, availabilities of raw materials and labour make mushroom growing economically profitable in India. Moreover, scope for intense diversification by cultivation of other edible mushrooms like oyster, shiitake, milky and other medicinal mushrooms are additional opportunities for Indian growers. At present, four mushrooms viz., Button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus spp), Paddy straw mushroom (Volvariella spp.) and Milky mushroom (Calocybe indica) have been recommended for round the year cultivation in India. India produces about 600 million tonnes of agricultural by products, which can profitably be utilized for the cultivation of mushrooms. Currently, we are using 0.04% of these residues for producing around 1.29 lakh tons of mushrooms of which 85% is button mushroom. India contributes about 3% of the total world button mushroom production. Even if we use 1% of the residues for mushroom production, we can produce 3.0 million tons of mushrooms, which will be almost equal to current global button mushroom production (current world production 3.4 million tons).

Mushroom being an indoor crop, utilizing vertical space offers a solution to shrinking land and better water utility. Mushrooms have been reported to be capable of transforming agro wastes like paddy straw into protein rich food and have been confirmed to be sources of single cell protein. Mushrooms contain rich source of carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids and dietary fibre. Vitamins such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, and the essential minerals selenium, copper and potassium are abundant in mushrooms. The foremost importance is that mushrooms do not have cholesterol, instead contain ergosterol that act as a precursor for vitamin D synthesis in human body. Mushrooms are believed to help fight against cancer, relieves hypertension, imparts protection from heart diseases. Mushroom crop is in fact a boon that can solve several problems like the protein malnutrition, unemployment issues and environmental pollution. 342 Mushrooms are cultivated indoors and do not require arable land and mushroom is a short duration crop with high yield per unit time. For small farmers and landless workers mushroom cultivation is highly suitable for the economic and social security of this group. This hi-tech horticulture venture relieves the pressure on arable land, because it cultivation is indoors, and is also more suited to the women folk. Mushrooms supplement and complement the nutritional deficiencies and are regarded as the highest producers of protein per unit area and almost 100 times more than the conventional agriculture and animal husbandry. At present, in Tamil Nadu the annual production of mushroom is around 11,000 tonnes, button mushroom accounts for 7,500 tonnes, Oyster mushroom accounts for 2700 tonnes and milky mushroom contributes for 800 tonnes. During the past two decades, the Mushroom Research and Training Centre of the Department of Plant Pathology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore has made tremendous efforts on transfer of mushroom cultivation technology by imparting trainings. By this way it has contributed for the establishment of about 50 spawn producers and 600 oyster mushroom growers accounting for 7- 8 tonnes / day, 50 button mushroom growers producing 18-20", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

CROP RESIDUE COMPOSTING Crop residues are the plant parts that are left in the field after harvest. The harvest refuses include straws, stubble, stover and haulms of different crops. Crop remains are also from thrashing sheds or that are discarded during crop processing. This includes process wastes like groundnut shell, oil cakes, rice husks and cobs of maize, sorghum and cumbu. The greatest potential as a biomass resource appears to be from the field residues of sorghum, maize, soybean, cotton, sugarcane etc. In Tamil Nadu 190 lakh tonnes of crop residues are available for use. These residues will contribute 1.0 lakh ton of nitrogen, 0.5 lakh ton of phosphorus and 2.0 lakh tons of potassium. However crop residues need composting before being used as manure. Waste collection Crop residues accumulated in different locations are to be brought", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

However crop residues need composting before being used as manure. Waste collection Crop residues accumulated in different locations are to be brought to compost yard. The compost yard should be located in anyone corner of the farm with accessibility via good road. Water resource should also be available in sufficient quantity. The crop residues that are brought to compost yard should be heaped in one corner for further processing. Shredding of waste materials Particle size is one of the factor that influence the composting. It is advisable to shred all the crop residues that are used for composting. Shredding the waste manually is labour intensive. Shredder machine can be employed to shred all the crop residue biomass. Particle size of 5 cm is recommended for quick composting. Mixing of green waste and brown waste Carbon and nitrogen ratio decides the initiation of composting process. If C:N ratio is wide (100:1) composting will not take place. Narrow C:N ratio of 30:1 is ideal for composting. To get a narrow C:N ratio, carbon and nitrogen rich material should be mixed together. Green coloured waste materials like glyricidia leaves, parthenium, freshly harvested weeds, sesbania leaves are rich in nitrogen, whereas brown coloured waste material like straw, coir dust, dried leaves and dried grasses are rich in carbon. In any composting process these carbon and nitrogen rich material is to be mixed together to make the composting quicker rather than putting green waste alone or brown color waste alone for composting. Animal dung is also a good source of nitrogen. While making heap formation, alternative layers of carbon rich material, animal dung and nitrogen rich material are to be heaped to get a quicker result in composting. Compost heap formation Minimum 4 feet height should be maintained for composting. The composting area should be elevated one and have sufficient shade. While heap formation, all the crop residues should be mixed together to form a heterogeneous material rather than a single homogenous material. Alternate layers of carbon and nitrogen rich material with intermittent layers of animal dung are essential. After heap formation the material should be thoroughly moistened. 348 Bioinputs for composting TNAU Biomineralizer consortium contains groups of microorganisms, which accelerate the composting process.

After heap formation the material should be thoroughly moistened. 348 Bioinputs for composting TNAU Biomineralizer consortium contains groups of microorganisms, which accelerate the composting process. If this inoculum is not added to the composting material, natural microorganisms establish on the waste material on its own and do the composting work. This process takes longtime. But if external source of inoculum is added, the microbial activity starts earlier and composting period will be reduced. For one tonne of crop wastes 2 kg of TNAU Biomineralizer is recommended. This two kg Biomineralizer should be mixed with 20 liters of water and made slurry. When the compost heap is formed in between layers the slurry should be inoculated, so that it mixes with the waste material thoroughly for uniform coating of microorganism on the waste material. Cow dung slurry is also a good source for microbial inoculum. But it carries unwanted microorganisms also which may compete with composting organism. But when TNAU Biomineralizer is not available, cow dung slurry is a good source material. For one tonne of crop residues 40 kg fresh cow dung is required. This 40 kg fresh cow dung is mixed with 100 litres of water and it should be thoroughly poured over the waste material. Cow dung slurry acts as nitrogen source as well as source of microbial inoculum. Aerating the compost material Sufficient quantity of oxygen should be available inside the compost heap. For this external air should be freely get in and comes out of the material. Normally to allow the fresh air to get inside, the compost heap should be turned upside down, once in fifteen days. In this process top layer comes to bottom and bottom layer goes to top. This process also activates the microbial process and compost process is hastened. In some cases air ventilating pipe maybe inserted vertically and horizontally, to allow the air to pass through. The wood chip that is available as waste in wood processing industry may also be used as bulking agent in the composting process. This bulking agent gives more air space to the compost material.

Moisture maintenance Throughout the composting period 60% moisture should be maintained. On any situation, compost material should not be allowed to dry. If the material becomes dry, all the microorganisms present in the crop residues will die and the compost process gets affected. Compost maturity Volume reduction, black colour, earthy odor, reduction in particle size are all the physical factors to be observed for compost maturity. After satisfying with the compost maturity index, the compost heap can be disturbed and spread on the floor for curing. After curing for one day, the composted material is sieved through 4 mm sieve to get uniform composted material. The residues collected after composting has to be again composted to finish the composting process. Compost enrichment The harvested compost should be heaped in a shade, preferably on a hard floor. The beneficial microorganisms like Azotobacteror, Azospirillum, Pseudomonas, Phosphobacteria (0.2%) and rock phosphate (2%) have to be inoculated for one ton of compost. Forty per cent moisture should be maintained for the maximum growth of inoculated microorganism. 349 This incubation should be allowed for 20 days for the organism to reach the maximum population. Now the compost is called as enriched compost. The advantage of enriched compost overnormal compost is the quality manure with higher nutrient status with high number of beneficial microorganisms and plant growth promoting substances. Nutritive value of Biocompost The nutritive value of biocompost varies from lot to lot because of varying input materials. But in general biocompost contains all the macro and micro nutrients required for crops, which is given in the following table.

Compost application Organic manures are highly regarded as good source of material to maintain soil health and increasing soil organic carbon content. Organic manures cannot be equated with inorganic fertilizers. But organic manures deliver all the nutrients to the soil but with little quantity. For one hectare of land 5 tons of enriched biocompost is recommended. It can be used as basal application in the field before taking up planting work.

ENRICHED ORGANIC MANURE FROM COIR DUST Enriched organic manure from coir dust is nutrient rich organic manure obtained by composting coir dust along with poultry manure, rock phosphate and microbial inoculants Pleurotus sajor-caju, Bacillus sp,Trichoderma sp and Pseudomonas sp. This is a simple and rapid technique to compost coir dust within 60 days. Inputs Coir dust : 1tonne Poultry manure : 200 kg Rock phosphate : 10 kg Pleurotussajor-caju : 2kg Microbial inoculants : 2kg (Bacillus sp + Trichoderma sp + Pseudomonas sp) 351 Methodology A partially shaded area should be selected for composting of coir dust. The floor of the selected area must be hard to prevent leaching of water or nutrients from the compost. Spread one tonne of coir dust over the floor selected for composting. A hard-cemented surface is ideal for composting. Otherwise the floor should be hardened by putting stones and other hardy materials. Poultry manure (200 kg) and rock phosphate (10 kg), Pleurotus sajor caju (2 kg), microbial inoculums (2 kg) consists of Bacillus, Trichoderma, and Pseudomonas are added to the coir dust. All the above materials are mixed together thoroughly with one tonne of coir dust. After thorough mixing it should be sprinkled with water and formed in to a heap. The moisture level should be maintained at 60% level through out the composting period. However water should not be dripped out of the composting material. For uniform composting of coir dust, the compost should be turned once in every 10 days. There will be reduction in volume of coir dust and all the material will be changed to black in color after 60th day with an earthy odor from the composted material. It will have high water holding capacity. The enriched coir dust compost contains the following nutrients. Nutritive value of Enriched Organic Manure from Coir Dust S. No. Parameters Composition 1.

The enriched organic manure from coir dust supplies macronutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium) as well as micronutrients (Iron, Manganese, Copper and Zinc) to the corps. 352 5. It is an excellent organic medium and basal manure for application in planting pits for crops and forest trees especially in areas of water scarcity and drought. 6. The enriched organic manure from coir dust is an excellent soil ameliorant and soil conditioner for correcting soil problems.Hence it can be used as a component of biological reclamation system for bringing alkaline, saline and also ill drained soils back to remunerative farming. III. COMPOSTING OF POULTRY WASTES Value addition of Poultry Waste through Composting technology Poultry industry is one of the largest and fastest growing livestock production systems in the world. In India, there are about 3430 million populations of poultry with a waste generation of 3.30 million tonnes per year. The localized nature of poultry production also means that it can represent a large percentage of the agricultural economy in many states or regions. Although economical and successful, the poultry industry is currently facing with a number of highly complex and challenging environmental problems, many of which are related to its size and geographically concentrated nature.

Although economical and successful, the poultry industry is currently facing with a number of highly complex and challenging environmental problems, many of which are related to its size and geographically concentrated nature. From an agricultural perspective, poultry wastes play a major role in the contamination of ground water through nitrate nitrogen. Also, the eutrophication of surface water due to phosphorus, pesticides, heavy metals and pathogens present in the poultry wastes applied to soils are the central environmental issues at the present time. Among the animal manures, poultry droppings have higher nutrient contents. It has nitrogen (4.55 to 5.46 %), phosphorus (2.46 to 2.82 %), potassium (2.02 to 2.32 %), calcium (4.52 to 8.15 %), magnesium (0.52 to 0.73 %) and appreciable quantities of micronutrients like Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn etc. In addition to this cellulose (2.26 to 3.62%), hermicellulose (1.89 to 2.77 %) and lignin (1.07 to 2.16 %) are also present in poultry waste. These components upon microbial action can be converted to value added compost with high nutrient status. In poultry droppings, nearly 60% of nitrogen which is present as uric acid and urea is lost through ammonia volatilization by hydrolysis. This loss of nitrogen reduces the agronomic value of the product, besides causing atmospheric pollution. Composting with amendment seems promising in conservation of nitrogen in poultry droppings. Nitrogen in poultry waste can be effectively conserved by composting with suitable organic amendment. The technologies developed will be highly useful to the poultry farmers. Method of preparation of poultry waste compost using coir pith Inputs required \u2022 Poultry droppings \u2022 Coirpith \u2022 Pleurotus sajor-caju Method A known quantity of the poultry waste as collected above along with coir pith is inoculated with Pleurotus sajor-caju@ 2 packets per tonne to speed up the composting process. This mixer should be placed under shade as heap. The moisture content of the heap should be maintained at 50 to 60%. Periodical turning must be given on 21st, 28th and 35th days of composting. Another two packets of Pleurotus sajor-caju is to be added during turning given on the 28th day of composting. Good quality compost will be attained after 45th day of composting. The nutrient contents of the composts of poultry litter collected from caged system and deep litter systems are as below; 353 Nutrient content Nitrogen (%) 2.08 \u2013 2.13 Phosphorous (%) 2.40 -2.61 Potassium (%) 2.03-2.94 C:N", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

If the temperature drops below 50\u00ba C, the heaps should be spread and moistened with water to bring the moisture content to 60%. \u2022 Colour of the compost will turn from brown to black. \u2022 The matured compost will be odourless. \u2022 The volume of the compost heap will be reduced to 1/3. \u2022 Temperature of the heap will be same as the ambient air temperature and stable. \u2022 Matured compost will be light and fine textured. \u2022 Moisture content of the heap can be measured using moisture meter or by taking handful of compost from the heap and squeezing it with the fingers. If excess water drips out from the compost, then it is considered to have >60 % moisture. If small quantity of water oozes out as drops, then moisture content is considered to be optimum i.e., 60%. \u2022 Each compost heap should have a minimum of one tonne to retain the heat for post decomposition. Value Animal manures especially poultry manure are rich in N and the nutrient value of the manure is reduced by loss of N through ammonia volatilization and denitrification. Good quality poultry manure can be obtained by mixing the poultry waste with selective carbonaceous material such as coirpith and inoculation with suitable microorganism. It can be used as an eco-friendly technique for the conversion of poultry waste into valuable compost. Benefits Poultry wastes contain higher concentrations of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus than wastes of other animal species and the presence of nutrients provides more incentive for the utilization of this resource. The loss of nitrogen from poultry droppings can be effectively conserved by composting with coir pith and serves as a good source of organic nutrients to agricultural fields. To make the organic nutrients present in poultry waste available to plants, the waste has to be composted suitably to minimize the volatilization of ammonia.

Applications The poultry waste compost will be a very good organic manure@6 ton / ha for all the crops. Limitations The uninterrupted availability of the raw materials has to be ensured for continuous production on a commercial scale. 354 IV. VERMICOMPOST Earthworms live in the soil and feed on decaying organic material. After digestion, the undigested material moves through the alimentary canal of the earthworm, a thin layer of oil is deposited on the castings. This layer erodes over a period of 2 months. So although the plant nutrients are immediately available, they are slowly released to last longer. The process in the alimentary canal of the earthworm transforms organic waste to natural fertilizer. The chemical changes that organic wastes undergo include deodorizing and neutralizing. This means that the pH of the castings is 7 (neutral) and the castings are odorless. The worm castings also contain bacteria, so the process is continued in the soil, and microbiological activity is promoted. Vermicomposting is the process of turning organic debris into worm castings. The worm castings are very important to the fertility of the soil. The castings contain high amounts of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. Castings contain: 5 times the available nitrogen, 7 times the available potash, and 1 \u00bd times more calcium than found in good top soil. Several researchers have demonstrated that earthworm castings have excellent aeration, porosity, structure, drainage, and moisture-holding capacity. The content of the earthworm castings, along with the natural tillage by the worms burrowing action, enhances the permeability of water in the soil. Worm castings can hold close to nine times their weight in water. \u201cVermiconversion,\u201d or using earthworms to convert waste into soil additives, has been done on a relatively small scale for some time. A recommended rate of vermicompost application is 15-20 per cent. Vermicomposting is done on small and large scales.

Phase 2 : Pre digestion of organic waste for twenty days by heaping the material along with cattle dung slurry. This process partially digests the material and fit for earthworm consumption. Cattle dung and biogas slurry may be used after drying. Wet dung should not be used for vermicompost production. Phase 3 : Preparation of earthworm bed. A concrete base is required to put the waste for vermicompost preparation. Loose soil will allow the worms to go into soil and also while watering, all the dissolvable nutrients go into the soil along with water. 355 Phase 4 : Collection of earthworm after vermicompost collection. Sieving the composted material to separate fully composted material. The partially composted material will be again put into vermicompost bed. Phase 5 : Storing the vermicompost in proper place to maintain moisture and allow the beneficial microorganisms to grow. Bedding Bedding is any material that provides the worms with a relatively stable habitat. This habitat must have the following characteristics: High absorbency Worms breathe through their skins and therefore must have a moist environment in which to live. If a worm\u2019s skin dries out, it dies. The bedding must be able to absorb and retain water fairly well if the worms are to thrive. Good bulking potential If the material is too dense to begin with, or packs too tightly, then the flow of air is reduced or eliminated. Worms require oxygen to live, just as we do. Different materials affect the overall porosity of the bedding through a variety of factors, including the range of particle size and shape, the texture, and the strength and rigidity of its structure. The overall effect is referred to in this document as the material\u2019s bulking potential.

Low protein and/or nitrogen content (high Carbon: Nitrogen ratio) Although the worms do consume their bedding as it breaks down, it is very important that this be a slow process. High protein/nitrogen levels can result in rapid degradation and its associated heating, creating inhospitable, often fatal, conditions. Heating can occur safely in the food layers of the vermiculture or vermicomposting system, but not in the bedding. VERMICOMPOST PRODUCTION METHODOLOGY i) Selection of suitable earthworm For vermicompost production, the surface dwelling earthworm alone should be used. The earthworm, which lives below the soil, is not suitable for vermicompost production. The African earthworm (Eudrillus engeniae), Red worms (Eisenia foetida) and composting worm (Peronyx excavatus) are promising worms used for vermicompost production. All the three worms can be mixed together for vermicompost production. The African worm (Eudrillus eugeniae) is preferred over other two types, because it produces higher production of vermicompost in short period of time and more young ones in the composting period. ii) Selection of site for vermicompost production Vermicompost can be produced in any place with shade, high humidity and cool. Abandoned cattle shed or poultry shed or unused buildings can be used. If it is to be produced in open area, shady place is selected. A thatched roof may be provided to protect the process from direct sunlight and rain. The waste heaped for vermicompost production should be covered with moist gunny bags. iii) Containers for vermicompost production A cement tub may be constructed to a height of 2\u00bd feet and a breadth of 3 feet. The 356 length may be fixed to any level depending upon the size of the room. The bottom of the tub is made to slope like structure to drain the excess water from vermicompost unit. A small sump is necessary to collect the drain water.In another option over the hand floor, hollow blocks / bricks may be arranged in compartment to a height of one feet, breadth of 3 feet and length to a desired level to have quick harvest. In this method, moisture assessment will be very easy. No excess water will be drained. Vermicompost can also be prepared in wooden boxes, plastic buckets or in any containers with a drain hole at the bottom. iv) Vermiculture bed Vermiculture bed or worm bed (3 cm) can be prepared by placing after saw dust or husk", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

A layer of fine sand (3 cm) should be spread over the culture bed followed by a layer of garden soil (3 cm). All layers must be moistened with water. v) Worm Food Compost worms are big eaters. Under ideal conditions, they are able to consume in excess of their body weight each day, although the general rule-of-thumb is \u00bd of their body weight per day. They will eat almost anything organic (that is, of plant or animal origin), but they definitely prefer some foods to others. Manures are the most commonly used worm feedstock, with dairy and beef manures generally considered the best natural food for Eisenia, with the possible exception of rabbit manure. The former, being more often available in large quantities, is the feed most often used.

All other waste should be predigested with cow dung for twenty days before put into vermibed for composting. vii) Putting the waste in the container The predigested waste material should be mud with 30% cattle dung either by weight or volume.

Over this material, the selected earthworm is placed uniformly. For one-meter length, one-meter breadth and 0.5-meter height, 1 kg of worm (1000 Nos.) is required. There is no necessity that earthworm should be put inside the waste. Earthworm will move inside on its own. 358 viii) Watering the vermibed Daily watering is not required for vermibed. But 60% moisture should be maintained throughout the period. If necessity arises, water should be sprinkled over the bed rather than pouring the water. Watering should be stopped before the harvest of vermicompost. ix) Harvesting vermicompost In the tub method of composting, the castings formed on the top layer are collected periodically. The collection may be carried out once in a week. With hand the casting will be scooped out and put in a shady place as heap like structure. The harvesting of casting should be limited up to earthworm presence on top layer. This periodical harvesting is necessary for free flow and retain the compost quality. Otherwise the finished compost get compacted when watering is done. In small bed type of vermicomposting method, periodical harvesting is not required. Since the height of the waste material heaped is around 1 foot, the produced vermicompost will be harvested after the process is over. x) Harvesting earthworm After the vermicompost production, the earthworm present in the tub / small bed may be harvested by trapping method. In the vermibed, before harvesting the compost, small, fresh cow dung ball is made and inserted inside the bed in five or six places. After 24 hours, the cow dung ball is removed. All the worms will be adhered into the ball. Putting the cow dung ball in a bucket of water will separate this adhered worm. The collected worms will be used for next batch of composting. xi) Nutritive value of vermicompost The nutrients content in vermicompost vary depending on the waste materials that is being used for compost preparation. If the waste materials are heterogeneous one, there will be wide range of nutrients available in the compost. If the waste materials are homogenous one, there will be only certain nutrients are available. The common available nutrients in vermicompost is as follows Organic carbon : 9.5 \u2013 17.98% Nitrogen : 0.5 \u2013 1.50% Phosphorous : 0.1", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

It should have minimum 40% moisture. Sunlight should not fall over the composted material. It will lead to loss of moisture and nutrient content. It is advocated that the harvested composted material is openly stored rather than packed in over sac. Packing can be done at the time of selling. If it is stored in open place, periodical sprinkling of water may be done to maintain 359 moisture level and also to maintain beneficial microbial population. If the necessity comes to store the material, laminated over sac is used for packing. This will minimize the moisture evaporation loss. Vermicompost can be stored for one year without loss of its quality, if the moisture is maintained at 40% level. 4. Advantages of vermicompost \u2022 Vermicompost is rich in all essential plant nutrients. \u2022 Provides excellent effect on overall plant growth, encourages the growth of new shoots / leaves and improves the quality and shelf life of the produce. \u2022 Vermicompost is free flowing, easy to apply, handle and store and does not have bad odour. \u2022 It improves soil structure, texture, aeration, and waterholding capacity and prevents soil erosion. \u2022 Vermicompost is rich in beneficial micro flora such as a fixers, P- solubilizers, cellulose decomposing micro-flora etc in addition to improve soil environment. \u2022 Vermicompost contains earthworm cocoons and increases the population and activity of earthworm in the soil. \u2022 It neutralizes the soil protection. \u2022 It prevents nutrient losses and increases the use efficiency of chemical fertilizers. \u2022 Vermicompost is free from pathogens, toxic elements, weed seeds etc. \u2022 Vermicompost minimizes the incidence of pest and diseases. \u2022 It enhances the decomposition of organic matter in soil. \u2022 It contains valuable vitamins, enzymes and hormones like", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Pests and diseases of vermicompost Compost worms are not subject to diseases caused by micro-organisms, but they are subject to predation by certain animals and insects (red mites are the worst) and to a disease known as \u201csour crop\u201d caused by environmental conditions. INDUSTRIAL WASTE UTILIZATION FOR LAND RECLAMATION AND CROP PRODUCTION Application of Untreated Distillery Effluent (Spentwash) for the Reclamation of Sodic Soils Amendments generally used to reclaim sodic soils are gypsum, phosphogypsum, iron pyrites and elemental sulphur. All these are inorganic in nature. Some of the organic amendments to reclaim the sodic soils are press-mud, farmyard manure (FYM), coir dust and green manures. The direct discharge of untreated distillery effluent (spentwash) to reclaim and improve the productivity of the sodic soils is now advocated. Untreated distillery effluent (spentwash) is acidic (pH: 3.8 \u2013 4.2) with considerable quantity of potassium, calcium and magnesium and traces of micronutrients. Organic compounds, mainly the humic related melanoidins improve the bio-catalytic potential of the treated soil. Hence, only one time application of 3.75 to 5.00 lakhs litres of untreated distillery effluent (spentwash) per hectare of sodic soils in summer months is recommended. Natural oxidation can be induced for a period of six weeks with two intermittent dry ploughing at a particular interval. Then, after 45 \u2013 60th day of application, soil is to be irrigated with 360 fresh water and drained. This treatment reduces the pH and exchangeable sodium percentage to normal level and increases the productivity of the sodic soils. After this reclamation practice, rice crop can be raised in the effluent applied field adopting the conventional cultivation technique. Application of this effluent again to the next crop/season or year after year and also to the land nearby drinking water sources is not advocated. Application of Treated Distillery Effluent to Crops \u2022 Treated distillery effluent contains nitrogen 1200 mg L-1, phosphate 500 mg L-1, potash 12000 mg L-1, calcium 1800 mg L-1 and iron 300 mg L-1. Since the effluent has higher dissolved salts, 50 times diluted effluent can be irrigated to sugarcane, banana, ragi, sunflower, grasses, cotton", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Since the effluent has higher dissolved salts, 50 times diluted effluent can be irrigated to sugarcane, banana, ragi, sunflower, grasses, cotton and soybean. \u2022 It can also be used as one time application to fallow land at the rate 20,000 to 40, 000 litres per hectare. It should be allowed for complete drying over a period of 20 to 30 days. The effluent applied field is to be thoroughly ploughed two times for the natural oxidation and mineralization of organic matter. After that, crops can be raised in the effluent applied field adopting the conventional methods. Application of this effluent again to the next crop/season or year after year and also to the land nearby drinking water sources is not advocated. Irrigation of Pulp and Paper Mill Effluents Pulp and paper effluents contain lot of dissolved solids and stabilized organic matter. The properly treated effluent with EC less than 1.2 dSm-1 as such can safely be used for irrigation with appropriate amendments viz., pressmud @ 5 tonnes ha-1 (or) fortified pressmud @ 2.5 tonnes ha-1 or daincha as in -situ green manure (6.25 tonnes ha-1). Though there were perceptible changes in soil pH, EC, available NPK, exchangeable cations, exchangeable sodium per cent and sodium absorption ratio, there is no detrimental effect due to sodium either on soil or plants grown in sandy loam soils with good drainage facilities. This treated effluent can be used for irrigation in these soils for the following crops and varieties along with recommended doses of amendments viz., pressmud @ 5 tonnes ha- 1, or fortified pressmud @ 2.5 tonnes ha-1 or daincha as in situ green manure (6.25 tonnes ha-1).

Chawki rearing and cleaning: In a tray of 120 cm x 90 cm x 10 cm size, 20 DFLs are brushed and reared till the end of second age. From brushing to the end of second age, the larvae are fed with tender leaves. The leaves are selected from the largest glossy leaf, 3rd and 4th from the top for I instar larvae. The 5th to 8th leaves are used to rear the second instar larvae. In the first age, one cleaning is given just a day before the worms settle for moult. In the second age, two cleanings are given, one after resumption of feeding and the other a day before the second moult. 7. Shoot rearing for late age worms Provide separate rearing house for shoot rearing in shady areas. Fabricate the rack stand with wood or steel and the rearing seat with wire mesh/bamboo mat. Shoot rearing rack of 1.2m x 11m size is sufficient to rear 50 DFLs. Provide 15cm border on all sides of the shelf to prevent the dispersal of the larvae.

AGROFORESTRY The present trend of growing trees in the farm lands demands for identification of economically potential tree species suitable to different climatic conditions and soil types. The concept of agroforestry implies sustained, combined management of the same piece of land for silvicultural, agricultural and pastural crops leading to an overall increase of production compared to single crop management. This practice is of immense importance to our country for it is intimately linked with the question of increasing wood and food production to meet the needs of burgeoning population and conservation of soil, land ,moisture resources which is vital for the tropical regions. Properly distributed tree growth acts as a foster mother to agriculture. This is particularly true in dry inhospitable climatic conditions. Tree growth in such cases conserves soil moisture, increasing atmospheric humidity, improves soil fertility, protects field crops against the scorching and desiccating effects of winds and generally makes the climate more equable and pleasant, thereby stepping up agricultural production. The silviculture of important agroforestry tree species viz., Eucalyptus sp., Casuarina spp, Ailanthus excelsa, Melia dubia, Tectona grandis, Santalum album , Pterocarpus santalinus, Neolamarckia cadamba and Leucaena leucocephala are given hereunder . 1.

Care should be taken to remove the culm without damaging the culm as well as mother clump. The removed culm should be delimbed carefully by leaving growing buds in the nodes. Then, the culm should be placed it in the raised nursery bed and covered with loose soil and sand mixture for half inch thickness. After providing adequate shade to the culms in the nursery bed with coconut sheaths or rice straw, watering should be done to field capacity. Watering twice a day should be continued and shoot emergence will be observed after one month from all buds present in all nodes of the entire culm. Continue watering up to three months. The root emergence could be observed in 2-3 months. After rooting, the rooted culm should be removed entirely from the soil without any damage. To facilitate uprooting the rooted culms without damage, watering should be done. Each rooted node with shoots should be separated with small hand saw. The separated cutting can be transferred to poly bag. MINI CLONAL PROPAGATION FOR TREE CROPS A mini clonal technology has been developed for casuarinas and Melia which is one of the pioneering attempts in the country for these industrial wood species. Under this technology, the superior clonal plants were planted in a mini clonal garden and are provided with regular irrigation and fertilization in order to enhance shoot multiplication. In this method, the mother plants are planted at 10 cm x 10 cm spacing and 60 days old plants are ready for collection of cuttings.

Clonal Management The plants are allowed to grow upto 60 days by applying the required nutrient composition. After 60 days the plants are pruned at required size preferably at half of the plant to induce new shoots. With continuous irrigation and nutrient management the cuttings will start producing shoots from 8-10 days onwards and after 15-20 days the cuttings can be collected and treated with 2% carbendazim solution. Clonal Treatment 398 The newly induced shoots were separated from the plants and are treated with or without 1500 ppm IBA (liquid formulation) and planted in 90 cc root trainers filled with decomposed coir pith. The rooting started in 15 days and 25 days old rooted plants are ready for hardening. Green House Conditions The root trainers are kept under green house conditions with a temperature regime of 32 \u2013 35\u00b0C and a relative humidity of 85-95%. Periodical watering once in every 30 minutes is preferred. Acclimatization and Hardening The rooted plants are hardened in a shade house condition with 50% shading for 7-15 days and maintained with adequate irrigations. After hardening chamber, the plants are lifted to open nursery for 30 days. Watering is done 2 times a day and the fertilizer of all 19 (N:P:K) can be applied at the rate of 5g/plant. During this hardening, application of carbendazim (2g/l) or triazophos (2ml/lr) is recommended based on the incidence of diseases and pests.

{"id": "pdf_409", "text": "VALUE ADDITION OF PLANTATION RESIDUES THROUGH BRIQUETTING TECHNLOGY Briquetting is the process of converting low bulk density biomass into high density and energy concentrated fuel briquettes besides compacting the loose biomass into dense block. Raw materials for Briquetting Almost all agro and forest residues can be briquetted. Agro and forest residues include saw dust, rice husk, groundnut shell, cotton stalks, wood chips etc. Forest residues such as plantation residues, mill residues (ply wood and match wood residues) can be used for making briquettes. All these residues can be briquetted individually and in combination with or without using binders. The factors that mainly influence the selection of raw materials are moisture content, ash content, flow characteristics, particle size and availability of raw materials. Moisture content in the range of 10-15% is preferred because high moisture content will pose problems in binding and more energy for drying. The ash content of biomass affects its slagging behaviour, operating conditions and mineral composition of ash. Biomass feedstock having upto 4% of ash content is preferred for briquetting. Granular homogeneous materials which can flow easily in conveyers are suitable for briquetting. Briquetting Process The series of steps involved in the briquetting process are as follows: i. Collection of raw material In general, any material that will burn but is not in a convenient shape, size or form to be readily usable as fuel is a good candidate for briquetting. ii. Preparation of raw materials Preparation of raw materials includes size reduction, drying, mixing of raw materials in correct proportion, mixing of raw materials with binders etc. iii. Size reduction Raw material is first reduced in size by chopping, crushing, breaking, rolling, 399 hammering, milling, grinding, cutting etc. until it reaches a suitably small and uniform sized material (1 to 10). For some material which are available in the size range of 1 to 10 mm need not be sized reduced. Since the size reduction process consumes a good deal of energy, this should be as short as possible. Biomass with irregular size which was difficult to handle. This size of biomass reduced with the help of Shredder machine. Biomass passed through the shredding machine for size reduction and powder of uniform size is made. Shredder size 22\u201d and sharp rotating blades rotated at a speed of 3300 RPM is used.

Shredder size 22\u201d and sharp rotating blades rotated at a speed of 3300 RPM is used. Generally sieve size is 1/16 inch. Drying Raw materials are available with high moisture content than what is required for briquetting. Drying can be dome in open air (sun), with a heater or with hot air. At the time of harvesting, the biomass contains more than 40 percentage of moisture content. For briquetting we need the moisture content of biomass to be in the range of 10-12 percent. Moisture reduction is done using a solar dryer. Raw material mixing It is done to make briquettes from more than one raw material. Mixing has to be done in proper way so that the product should have good compaction and high calorific value. Mixing of raw material with binders Mixing of raw materials with binders in correct proportion is important for the production of briquettes with good compaction. This is best accomplished by a trial and error method of making several briquettes with different mixtures of binding material and testing each for its mechanical strength and burning characteristics. The cost of binding material can be a critical factor for economic success of the project. Natural or synthetic resins, tar, animal manure , molasses, lingo-sulphates, sewage mud, fish water, algae, starch, slime, clay, mud, and cement are some of the binders used in briquetting process. Compaction Compaction process takes place inside the briquetting machine and the process depends on the briquetting technology adopted. Cooling and storage of briquettes Briquettes extruding out of the machine are hot with temperatures exceeding 200\u00b0c and hence they have to be cooled and stored.

This agroforestry combines the production of diverse but essential resources for local subsistence. The traditional agroforestry has not seen as an intensive or highly optimised production concept. However, its importance and strength is located within its diverse usability in long term production system and comparatively sustainable impacts in environment and ecosystem functions. The traditional agroforestry system has been utilized as a land use system to increase the livelihood security and reduce the vulnerability to climate and environmental change. The agroforestry systems have provided food, fuel, and fodder besides protecting the natural resources. But today, the rapid phases of population growth coupled with developmental projects have necessitated large volume of wood and wood products from tree outside forests particularly from agroforestry plantations. The industrialization and globalization has made production process more intensified and highly specialized. However, the agroforestry practices are unable to keep up with the higher economic and mono-culture oriented production. In India, the agroforestry supports nearly 72% of fuel wood demand, over 70% of plywood, 60-80% of pulpwood and around 11% of fodder needs besides satisfying the domestic needs of the society. In case of timber demand the agroforestry is able to meet 2/3rd of the requirement. The role of agroforestry in soil water conservation, Biodiversity conservation and mitigation and adaptation to climate change are very well established. Hence, agroforestry has played a significant role in extending the multifunctional benefits to the society and to the environment. Against this back drop Forest College and Research Institute has conceived and developed a Multifunctional agroforestry model for adoption to double the farmer\u2019s income through enhancing productivity per unit area.

The unique Indian situation of small fragmented holdings and lack of capital investments is not suitable for single commodity farming being practiced in developed countries. So, the integrated farming system appears to be a viable solution to the Indian agriculture for increasing productivity and income of the small and marginal farmers with constrained resources. Efforts for a holistic integration of different farming enterprises with cropping were carried out for Western, Cauvery delta, Southern and North western zones out of seven agro climatic zones of Tamil Nadu with the objectives of increasing income and recycling of farm wastes and by-products to sustain the soil productivity since 1985. The approaches were to find out viable components for wetland, irrigated upland and rainfed situations existing in different ecological zones. INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS 1. WESTERN ZONE WETLAND Integrated farming systems experiments were conducted at wetlands from 1987- onwards at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore involving different components viz., poultry, pigeon, goat, fishery and mushroom. Crop + poultry/ pigeon + fish + mushroom In this system, the component of integrated farming system involved were crop + fish + mushroom, crop + poultry + fish + mushroom and crop + pigeon + fish + mushroom and was taken from 1993\u20131995. The efficiency of the component linkages was evaluated predominantly on the basis of productivity, its income and employment generation with the possibility of utilizing recycled organic wastes as nutrient to enrich the soil fertility. To enhance and sustain the productivity, economic returns, employment generation for the family labour round the year and soil fertility with environmental protection, integration of rice-gingelly- maize and rice- soybean -sunflower cropping each in 0.45 ha with recycled poultry manure as fish pond silt to rice and 75 per cent of the recommended NPK to each crop in the system + poultry (50 layers) + fish (1000 polyculture fingerlings in 0.10 ha of ponded water) comprising catla (20 per cent), silver carp (20 per cent), rohu (20 per cent), mrigal (15 per cent), common carp (15 per cent) and grass carp (10 per cent) fed with poultry dropping + oyster mushroom (5kg/day) for the lowland farmers having one hectare farm.

Cropping + poultry / pigeon / goat + fishery During 1998-2001, the study involved cropping, poultry, pigeon, goat and fishery enterprises in all possible combinations, with a view to recycle the residue and by- products of one component over the other. In one hectare farm, an area of 0.75 ha was assigned for crop activity, 0.10 ha for growing fodder grass to feed the goat unit (20+1), 0.03 ha allotted to goat shed and the remaining 0.12 ha allotted to 3 fish ponds. Three integrated farming systems viz., crop + fish + poultry (20 Bapkok layer birds), crop + fish + 403 pigeon (40 pairs) and crop + fish + goat (Tellicherry breed of 20 female and 1 male maintained in 0.03 ha deep litter system) were tried for three years. Polyculture fingerlings of 400 numbers (catla, rohu, mirgal/ common carp and grass carp) in the ratio of 40:20:30:10, respectively, reared in 3 ponds of size 0.04 ha (depth of 1.5 m) each. Integration of crop with fish, poultry, pigeon and goat resulted in higher productivity than cropping alone under lowland. Crop + fish + goat integration recorded higher rice grain equivalent yield of 39610 kg/ha. The highest net return of Rs.131118 and per day return of Rs.511 ha-1 were obtained by integrating goat + fish + cropping applied with recycled fishpond silt enriched with goat droppings. Higher net return of Rs.3.36 for every rupee invested was obtained by integration of pigeon + fish + cropping applied with recycled fishpond silt enriched with pigeon droppings. The poultry, pigeon and goat droppings were utilized as feed initially and at the end of a year after the fish harvest, about 4500 kg of settled silt from each pond were collected. The pond silt was utilized as organic sources to supply sufficient quantity of nutrients to the crops.

Cropping + dairy + biogas + fish + mushroom integration recorded the highest gross, net and per day returns. It also registered the highest benefit cost ratio of 2.41 during 2000-2001. On farm study was conducted during 2004-2007. The crop activity in integrated farming system consisted of field crop, vegetable crop and fodder crops. The livestock kept were two cross bred milch cows + one calf, ten female tellicherry does + one buck and twenty guinea fowls. Improved farming system gave the maximum maize grain equivalent yield of 22,754 kg/ac/year which was 47.9 % higher than the traditional farming system. The improved system was able to generate employment of 235 man day\u2019s acre-1 which was higher than traditional farming system (105 man day\u2019s acre-1). Through recycling of crop residues and livestock manure about 3.72 tonnes of bio-compost and 1.59 tonnes of vermicompost were obtained. This could able to supply 26.0, 22.3, and 26.0 kg N P K to field and fodder crops through biocompost application and 39.4,10.5 and 18.0 kg NPK to vegetable crops as vermicompost application in an acre land area.

CAUVERY DELTA ZONE Cropping + fish + poultry/duck/goat/dairy An experiment was conducted during 1992-1994 in rice based farming system as a demonstration trial at Aduthurai. The components were cropping, fish culture and poultry. An area of 0.40 ha was selected for the farming system study, considering the small and marginal farmers of the state. Conventional cropping as practised by farmers was taken up in an area of 0.96 hectare. In the fish pond with 400 m2, fingerlings belonging to the species viz., Catla (Catla catla) (200) Rohu (Labeo rohita) (100), Mirgal (Cirrbinus mrigala) (100) were stocked. The economics worked out for the system as a whole was Rs.28.983, in which cropping system contributed Rs.23,709, Poultry and Fisheries contributed additional income of Rs.5,274. Poultry droppings added to the fish pond as feed was 3 tonnes year-1 (100g/birds). Mean number of egg production was 262 year-1 bird-1. In the case of fish pond (0.04) yield recorded was 234 kg. Of the income obtained from the integrated farming system, 78% was from cropping system and poultry cum fisheries generated additional income and employment.

Net income of Rs.13790/- was obtained from existing cropping system (Kuruvai-thaladi rice - pulse) and a net income of Rs.22676/- was obtained from the modified cropping system (Kuruvai - thaladi rice - cotton and maize) with an area of 0.973 ha allotted for cropping. The additional profit from modified cropping alone was Rs.8886/-. From duck- cum-fish culture as a component in mixed farming system, a net profit of Rs.1441/- was obtained from an area of 0.027 ha. Totally an additional income of Rs.10327/- was obtained from the mixed farming system over existing cropping system. 405 3. SOUTHERN ZONE WETLANDS OF TAMBIRAPARANI COMMAND AREA Evaluation of integrated farming system for wetland farms was conducted during 1990-92. The components of the traditional and integrated farming systems are as follows: Traditional system (1 ha) : Rice \u2013 Rice \u2013 Fallow Integrated farming system (1 ha) : Crop + dairy + fishery 0.4 ha : Rice-rice + soybean (bund) \u2013 blackgram 0.2 ha : Ragi + sunflower (border) \u2013 fodder maize + cowpea \u2013 cotton + Greengram 0.2 ha : Bajra napier hybrid fodder grass 0.1 ha : Desmanthus 0.04 ha : Fish pond 0.06 ha : Cattle shed for 3 jersey cows and 2 work bullocks The integrated farming system provided a net income of Rs.25,215/- which was 100.7 per cent more than the income from the traditional rice farming (Rs.12,662/- On-farm studies were also undertaken to assess the economic benefits of integrated farming systems actually practised by wetland farmers of Tirunelveli-Kattabomman district during 1990. The study covered four farms in four villages with a farm size of 1-2 ha, raising rice, banana and pulses. The allied activities includes dairy, goat rearing, poultry and fishery. The average monthly income of the farm family practicing the integrated farming system varied from Rs.1,850 to 2,560.

WETLANDS OF PERIYAR VAIGAI COMMAND AREA In the Periyar \u2013 Vaigai command area, nearly one lakh hectares are raised with a single crop of rice during August \u2013 January. The lands are usually left fallow after rice harvest in January. To assess the potential of IFS in such single crop wetlands, experiments were conducted at Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai during 1989-91. The results revealed that by crop intensification, diversified cropping and by inclusion of fishery and poultry, the farm income per acre could be increased by Rs.5435 to Rs.6235 per year. DRY LANDS OF SOUTHERN ZONE To identify suitable integrated farming for the dry lands, experiments were conducted at Regional Research Station, Aruppukottai and Agricultural Research Station, Kovilpatti. In the rainfed black soils, the common crops are sorghum, pulses, cotton and sunflower. Introduction of tree legumes like subabul, Acacia senegal and Prosopis cineraria and perennial fodder grass Cenchrus ciliaris and inclusion of goat rearing were evaluated at Regional Research Station, Aruppukottai. Five female and one male goat of Tellicherry breed were raised in deep litter system. The results revealed that the IFS yielded an additional income of Rs.2163 to Rs.2556 per year from a farm area of 1.6 ha. In another study at Aruppukottai proved the IFS system of crop + horticulture + goat proven to be successful in the black soils and increased the profit by Rs.2363 to Rs.4706 per ha over cropping alone. At Agricultural Research Station, Kovilpatti, studies were taken in farmers\u2019 holdings in the dryland red soils. IFS with crop+goat yielded an annual income of Rs.8410 per ha compared to Rs.4654 per ha under traditional cropping alone. 406 4. NORTH WESTERN ZONE The studies were made under garden land condition. The results revealed that in both Paiyur and Yercaud Centres dairy linked farming system was more remunerative, with more employment generation. The next successful farming system under rainfed condition at Paiyur was sericulture.

SOIL RELATED CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT A constraint free soil environment is very important for achieving higher food production. The major soil constraints affecting the crop production in Tamil Nadu are a) Chemical constraints : salinity, sodicity, acidity and nutrient toxicities b) Physical constraints : high or low permeability, sub soil hard pan, surface crusting, fluffy paddy soils, sandy soils etc. 1. Saline soils Saline soils are characterised by higher amount of water soluble salt, due to which the crop growth is affected. For these soils with electrical conductivity of more than 4 dS m -1, provision of lateral and main drainage channels of 60 cm deep and 45 cm wide and leaching of salts could reclaim the soils.

For these soils with electrical conductivity of more than 4 dS m -1, provision of lateral and main drainage channels of 60 cm deep and 45 cm wide and leaching of salts could reclaim the soils. Application of farm yard manure at 5 t ha -1 at 10 - 15 days before transplanting in the case of paddy crop and before sowing in the case of garden land crops can alleviate the problems of salinity. 2. Sodic soils Sodic soils are characterised by the predominance of sodium in the complex with the exchangeable sodium percentage exceeding 15 and the pH more than 8.5 .To reclaim the sodic soils, plough the soil at optimum soil moisture regime, apply gypsum at 50% gypsum requirement uniformly, impound water, provide drainage for leaching out the soluble salts and apply green manure at 5 t ha-1 10 to 15 days before transplanting in the case of paddy crop. 3. Acid soils Acid soils are characteristically low in pH (< 6.0). Predominance of H+ and Al 3+ cause acidity resulting in deficiency of P, K, Ca, Mg , Mo and B. This soils are prevalent in a) hilly tracts of Ooty, Kodaikkanal and Yercaud b) Laterite soils of Pudukkottai, Kanyakumari etc Application of lime (as per the lime requirement test) uniformly by broadcast and incorporation is recommended. The alternate amendments like dolomite, basic slag, flue dust, wood ash, pulp mill lime may also be used on lime equivalent basis. 4. Iron and Aluminum toxicity These are characterized by the presence of higher concentration of Fe 2+ and Al 3+ more specifically in flooded soils. Prevalent in Kanyakumari and Pudukkottai Districts. Application of lime as per the lime requirement along with the recommended dose of NPK and organic manure will suppress the toxicity. For ` Ela ` soils of Kanyakumari district (Alfisols, pH : 4-5 ) ,. application of lime as per lime requirement with recommended NPK + foliar spray of 0.5 % ZnSO4 + 0.2% CuSO4 +1% DAP + 1% MOP thrice during AT to PI will help to overcome the problem in rice.

Fluffy paddy soils The traditional method of preparing the soil for transplanting rice consists of puddling which results in substantial break down of aggregates with uniform structures less mass. Under continuous flooding and submergence of soil in a rice-rice-rice cropping system, the soil particles are always in a state of flux and the mechanical strength is lost leading to the fluffy ness. This is further aggrevated by insitu application of rice stubbles and weeds during puddling. They are characterized by low bulk density of the top soil resulting in the sinking of farm animals and labourers as well as poor anchorage to paddy seedlings. For such soils, passing of 400 kg stone roller or oil drum with sand inside eight times at proper moisture level (moisture level at friable condition of soil which is approximately 13 per cent) once in two to three years. 6. Sandy soils Sandy soils are containing predominant amounts of sand resulting in higher percolation rates and nutrient losses. Campacting the soil with 400 kg stone roller or oil drum with sand / stones inside eight times at proper moisture level ( moisture level at friable condition of soil which is approximately 13 per cent ) once in two to three years could reduce the percolation losses. Addition of tank silt for coastal sandy soils is recommended for enhancing their productivity. 7. Sub Soil hard pan Hard pan occurs in red soil areas due to the movement of clay and iron hydroxides and calcium carbonate and settling at shallow depth, which increases the soil bulk density to more than 1.8 g/cc, their by preventing the root proliferation. These soils can be reclaimed by chiselling the soils with chisel plough at 0.5 m interval first in one direction and then in the direction perpendicular to the previous one, once in two to three years. Applications of FYM or composted coir pith at 12.5 t ha-1could bring additional yields of about 30 per cent over control.

Applications of FYM or composted coir pith at 12.5 t ha-1could bring additional yields of about 30 per cent over control. Deep ploughing of the field during summer season can be followed to open up the sub soil. Cultivation of deep rooted crops like tapioca, cotton and semipereneal crop like mulberry encourage natural breaking of the hardpan. 8. Surface crusted soils Surface crusting occurs due to the presence of colloidal oxides of iron and aluminium in Alfisols which binds the soil particles under wet regimes. On drying it forms a hard mass on the surface and prevents the emerging seedlings and arrest the free exchange of gases between the soil and atmosphere. The surface crust can be easily broken by harrowing or cultivator ploughing and its formation can be prevented by improving the aggregate stability by the application of lime or gypsum at 2 t ha-1 and FYM at 12.5 t ha-1. Sprinkle water at periodic intervals. Bold grain crops like cowpea may be grown 9. Heavy textured clay soils The clay soils are containing major amounts of clay resulting in the poor permeability and nutrient fixation. Such soils can be reclaimed by the addition of river sand at 100 t ha-1 or managed by deep ploughing the field with mould board plough or 411 disc plough during summer or forming contour and compartmental bunds and also adoption of ridges and furrows to enhance the infiltration and percolation. 10. Low permeable black soils These soils are having infiltration rate less than 6 cm per day due to high clay content. The amount of water entering in to the soil is reduced, resulting in high run off encouraging the erosion of surface soil with nutrients. Heavy clay and high capillary porosity results in impeded drainage and reduced soil conditions.

CHISEL TECHNOLOGY The occurrence of hard pans at shallow depth is the most prevalent soil physical constraint in soils. The agricultural crops are denied of the full benefits of the soil fertility and nutrient use due to this constraint. The sub-soil hard pans are characterized by high bulk density (1.8 g cc.') which in turn lowers infiltration, water storage capacity, available water and movement of air and nutrients, with concomitant adverse effect on the yield of crops. This problem is predominantly present in six districts of Tamil Nadu viz., Coimbatore, Erode, Dharmapuri, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai and Salem particularly under rainfed farming affecting a total of 3.8 lakh hectares of land. TECHNOLOGY Plough the field with chisel plough at 50 cm interval in both the directions viz., horizontally and vertically. Chiselling helps to break the hard pan in the sub soil. Besides, it ploughs upto 45cm depth. Chisel plough is a heavy iron plough which goes up to 45 cm depth, thereby shattering the hard pans. It is usually drawn by the tractor. Fabrication of chisel plough has been done by the Department of Farm Machinery, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore. (cid:131) Spread 12.5 t of FYM / pressmud / composted coir pith per hectare evenly on the surface. (cid:131) Give two ploughings using a country plough for incorporating the added manures.

SURGE IRRIGATION Even as advanced pressure irrigation method, such as drip and sprinkler systems are in vogue the traditional gravity surface irrigation methods still remain inevitable due to their simplicity in layouts and low installation and operational expenses. However the short strip furrow and check basin layouts (the primary surface irrigation methods in Tamilnadu) warrant division of the irrigated fields into a number of square or rectangular (2 m x 2 m to 6 m x 6 m ) plots encompassed by criss- cross ridges and feeder channels for facilitating irrigation flow from head to tail end of the field. This eventually results in prolonged irrigation application time and reduced irrigation efficiencies of 55 - 65% only due to excessive seepage, deep percolation and runoff losses (35-45%). Besides, the criss- cross layout with cross ridges and feeder channels leads to land loss of 15 -25%. In view of minimizing the land and water loss and to accomplish high level of irrigation and water use efficiencies a relatively new surface irrigation method called \u201csurge irrigation\u201d was introduced in TNAU with extensive experimental trials on it\u2019s hydraulic performance evaluation and crop compatibility during 1992-95. Features of Surge irrigation The term \u201c Surge irrigation\u201d refers to the delivering irrigation flows into individual long furrows (more than 25 m upto 200 m) in an intermittent fashion of predetermined ON-OFF time cycles (5 minute to 10 minutes) with the design duration of irrigation. During the ON time water front advances into the furrow over a certain length and during the subsequent OFF time the water applied partially saturates the soil and infiltration rate gets reduced on the advanced length. When water is delivered in the succeeding ON time, the water front advance gets accelerated due to the reduced intake rate and eventually it reaches the tail end of long furrow with in 30 - 50% of the design duration of irrigation. This process of ON-OFF water supply and cutoff results in highly minimized deep percolation and runoff losses (hardly exceeding 20%). Hence, high uniformity of soil moisture distribution with in the effective root zone", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

This process of ON-OFF water supply and cutoff results in highly minimized deep percolation and runoff losses (hardly exceeding 20%). Hence, high uniformity of soil moisture distribution with in the effective root zone is achieved over the entire furrow length resulting in enhanced irrigation efficiencies of more than 85% to 95%. In addition due to the series of long furrows emanating from a single head channel, the criss - cross ridges and feeder channel of division are eliminated thereby limiting the land loss within 5% only. Contributions of TNAU in surge irrigation research \u2022 Manual semi automated and automated surge irrigation layouts were designed and the irrigation parameters such as the individual furrow discharges (30 lit/min to 120 lit/min), surge cycle ON-OFF times (5 min to 30 min), surge cycle ratio (0.25 to 0.66), furrow gradients (0.1% to 0.6%), furrow size (30-120cm) and furrow length (50-200m) could be optimized through mathematical models. \u2022 A significant contribution from TNAU is the development of an original emprical model for the prediction of waterfront advance times and resulting in irrigation water distribution efficiencies. 414 Soil suitability : Sandy clay loam and loamy soils only Crops tested maize sunflower and sorghum Water saving : 25-40% Land saving : 15-25% Labour saving : 40% Limitations Surge irrigation systems do not show marked differences in land and water saving in extremely clay or sandy soils. Besides, surge irrigation technology is still in the infant stage in India and requires popularization through extension methods. 21. MICRO IRRIGATION Micro irrigation is a modern method of irrigation; by this method water is irrigated through drippers, sprinklers, foggers and by other emitters on surface or subsurface of the land. Major components of a micro irrigation system is as follows. Water source, pumping devices (motor and pump), ball valves, fertigation equipments, filters, control valves, PVC joining accessories (Main and sub main) and emitters. In this system water is applied drop by drop nearer the root zone area of the crop. The drippers are fixed based on the spacing of crop. Many different types of emitters are available in the market. They are classified as Inline drippers, on line drippers, Micro tubes, Pressure compensated drippers. Drip irrigation is most suitable for wider spacing crops.

Micro sprinkler irrigation system is mostly followed in sandy or loamy soils. This system is most suitable to horticultural crops and small grasses. In this method water is sprinkled in a lower height at various directions. Portable micro sprinklers are also available. They distribute slightly more water than drippers and micro sprinklers. They spray water in not more than one meter. It is used for preparing nursery and lawns in soils with low water holding capacity. Advantages of drip irrigation system \u2022 Water saving and higher yield \u2022 High quality and increased fruit size \u2022 Suitable for all types of soil \u2022 Easy method of fertigation and chemigation \u2022 Saving in labour and field preparation cost Disadvantage of drip irrigation system \u2022 High initial investment \u2022 Clogging of emitters \u2022 Possible damage of system components due to animals, etc., Investment cost mostly differs based on spacing of the crops \u2022 Generally, the reasons for clogging are solid particles (sand, rust), soft dirt (organic matter, algae, micro organism, salt), sediments (salt in the fertilizers). \u2022 Filtration is the main key factor to the success or failure of the system. The aim of filtration is to stop dirt particles which damage any components of the system. 415 \u2022 To remove salt encrustation, 30 per cent commercial hydrochloric acid can been used at the rate of one liter per one m3 of system discharge. \u2022 To remove algae and fungal clogging 5 to 500 ppm sodium hydrochloride (10 per cent chlorine) can be used. Maintenance of drip system \u2022 Back washing and sand filters has to be cleaned \u2022 Frequent cleaning of emitters and drippers \u2022 Flushing at every irrigation \u2022 Cleaning of sub main and main pipes \u2022 Cleaning of PVC pipes and laterals and acid or chlorine may be used to remove clogging.

In this system fertilizer solution is distributed evenly in irrigation. The availability of nutrients is very high therefore the efficiency is more. In this method liquid fertilizer as well as water soluble fertilizers are used. By this method, fertilizer use efficiency is increased from 80 to 90 per cent.

It is very easy to handle and it is affordable even by small farmers. This equipment is most suitable for smaller area. Fertilizer tank A tank containing fertilizer solution is connected to the irrigation pipe at the supply point. Part of the irrigation water is diverted through the tank diluting the nutrient solution and returning to the main supply pipe. The concentration of fertilizer in the tank thus becomes gradually reduced. Fertilizer pump The fertilizer pump is a standard component of the control head. The fertilizer solution is held in non-pressurised tank and it can be injected into the irrigation water at any desired ratio. Therefore the fertilizer availability to each plants is maintained properly. 419 Cost of fertigation equipments Sl.No. Fertigation devices Cost (Rs.) 1. Ventury type 1200 2. Fertilizer Tank 3000 3.

The initial cost will be almost 75 - 85 thousand rupees per hectare for wider spacing crops such as coconut, mango, grapes and for orchard crops. The initial cost is approximately 1 - 1.25 lakh rupees per hectare for close spacing crops such as sugarcane, banana, papaya, mulberry, turmeric, tapioca, vegetables and flower crops.

AGROMETEOROLOGY CROP PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT DRYLAND 1. Length of Growing Period Length of growing period is defined as a period in which the available soil moisture is enough to meet the evapotranspiration requirement of dry land crops and hence the dry land productivity is assured. Based on scientific study (Jeevananda Reddy, 1983), length of growing period for different rain gauge stations of each district of different agroclimatic zones of Tamil Nadu have been computed. The length of growing period is given as \u2018G\u2019 with starting and ending of length of growing period in terms of Meteorological standard weeks. If the G is less than 5 weeks period it means that always crop failures will occur. The G period must be a minimum of 14 weeks (98 days) which permit the dry land crop to attain its potential productivity. If the growing period is 14 weeks, a single dry land crop can be cultivated. If G period is between 14 to 20 weeks, suitable inter cropping system can be recommended. If the G period is more than 20 weeks long duration crop / double crop can be organized. The following information indicates length of growing period for different district of Tamil Nadu. Based on the G period, suitable dry land crop may be selected. 1.

Weather Based Management Technologies i) Nutrient management for thaladi season rice Application of 200:75:75kg NPK/ha for November 15th transplanted crop (Co45 or Co43) under split application of N at 40, 20, 20 and 20% respectively during basal, active tillering, panicle initiation and flowering while 75 percent P and K as basal and 12.5 percent P and K as foliar spray twice at panicle initiation and flowering stages. ii) Acceptable insitu moisture conservation practice for rainfed groundnut \u2013 sunflower and maize During South West monsoon season groundnut sowing along the contour and ridging to be done three weeks after sowing. During NEM, especially for sunflower, the same technology of contour sowing followed by ridging three weeks latter can be adopted. In respect of maize, sowing and tieing alternate furrows with mulching of locally available material can be practiced. iii) Sustainable dryland management for hybrid maize (UMH 28) Sowing of dry land hybrid maize at 38th meteorological standard week (17th \u2013 23 Sept.) with modified crop production recommendation based on medium range weather forecast is suggested. iv) Time of sowing and nutrient level for sorghum under different rainfall situations in dryland (black soil) of western agro climate zone of Tamil Nadu Sowing of sorghum variety CSV15 before the receipt of monsoon rainfall (Premonsoon sowing) is recommended with 60:30:0 kg NPK / ha during above average rainfall year and 40:20:0 Kg NPK / ha during below average rainfall year. The result is applicable when seasonal climate forecast information is available in advance. v) Technical feasibility of introducing new irrigated cropping system of Greengram \u2013 Maize \u2013 Sunflower against the outdated cropping system of Cotton \u2013 Sorghum \u2013 Finger millet of western agro climatic zone of Tamil Nadu Sowing of crops at normal sowing of concerned crops viz.; 33 Meteorological Standard Week (MSW) for (Aug 13-19) greengram, 48th MSW (Nov 26-Dec2) for maize and 15th MSW (April 9-15) for sunflower with 100 percent inorganic source of 435 recommended nutrients for green gram (12.5:50:0", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

The model was validated and the deviation is around 10 percent. The model was developed for both for Aliyarnagar (mountain climate) and Vridhachalam (Marine climate) domain. 7. Basic information i. Crop \u2013 weather studies Rice grain yield of Kuruvai and Thaladi seasons over 30 years (1961 \u2013 1990) were correlated with concerned weather data. Reproductive stage was very critical to prevalence weather parameters both for Kuruvai and Thaladi seasons. In addition maturity stage of Kuruvai and Vegetative stage of thaladi season were also critical to weather. During Thaladi season, correlation study indicated the positive relationship for maximum temperature at vegetative and reproductive stages. ii.

Conversely there is 436 only 32% chance of achieving such a yield in years when the SOI is falling. Similar analysis was conducted for cotton and economic performance of both systems was compared on gross margin basis. Results indicate that in positive SOI years, peanuts out performed in cotton in 70 percent of years, but income difference can still range from Rs.(-)15,000 to (+) 15,000 / ha. However under falling SOI conditions peanut only had minor advantage in 40% of years (up to Rs.3,800/ ha). iii. Seasonal rainfall Vs El-Nino Analyses of long term average of Southwest monsoon rainfall during El-Nino years revealed that during El-Nino years, the amount of rainfall found decreased in all the locations of Tamil Nadu as compared to normal rainfall of this season, except Northeastern parts of Tamil Nadu. Analyses of long term Northeast monsoon rainfall indicate that during El-Nino years there was increase in amount of rainfall than normal in all the locations of Tamil Nadu. iv. Tamil years Vs annual rainfall forecast The annual rainfall of a particular Tamil year in a cycle of 60 years was not the same for the corresponding Tamil years on the forth coming cycle and one can expect an opposite event. v. Stars Vs Seasonal rainfall forecast The star Revathi had greater influence on rainfall during hot weather period (March- May) while during Southwest monsoon (June \u2013 Sept) and Northeast monsoon seasons (Oct \u2013 Dec), stars Maham and Uthiram respectively did influence seasonal rainfall. In the monthly analysis at 30% probability, the star Uthiram had influenced in getting rainfall of > 20mm during July and November months. While during other months the stars viz. Maham, Pooradam, Kettai, Swathi and Moolam showed their influence to get < 20mm of rainfall. vi.

In the case of aphid, maximum temperature, diurnal variation, Relative Temperature Disparity, bright sunshine hours, and wind speed, had negative relationship, while positive correlation was observed for minimum temperature. vii. Study on the weather relationship of eriophyid mite in coconut The maximum temperature had negative correlation with nuts affected in all the varieties (Tall (east coast), Dwarf (yellow), Tall X Dwarf, Orange, and Dwarf X Tall) at three months after spathe emergence; where as positive correlation was obtained for maximum temperature one to two months before spathe emergence in respect of Tall (east coast) and Dwarf x Tall varieties. In general eriophyid mite affected nuts were either positively and negatively influenced by minimum temperature and relative 437 humidity respectively (0722 IST and 1422 IST). From the stepwise regression analysis made, one to two months earlier or one to two months after spathe emergence, wind speed had higher influence on the nuts affected with mite irrespective of varieties except Tall x Dwarf . viii. Probing the association of lunar phases \u201cThithies\u201d with rainfall at Coimbatore Based on the interaction between earth and moon in relation to sun, each month is governed by both new moon and full moon. In between these two, there are fourteen thithies covering the 14 days interval. A study was undertaken to find out the association between rainfall and the different thithies. Results revealed that the first eight thithies succeeding new moon, and eight thithies preceding the new moon did relate to annual rainfall events. Higher rainfall occurred normally during the eight thithies preceding the new moon as compared to thithies succeeding the new moon. Almost similar results could be noticed for both Southwest and Northeast monsoon seasons. Analysis also indicated that towards full moon phase, the thithi Shasthi (sixth phase) is associated with high rainfall while such effect was noticed at Ekadasi (eleventh phase) thithi towards new moon. High intensity events occurred frequently during new moon phase as compared to full moon phase. 8.

Since rainfall varies in space and time, there is risk in farming for dry land crop production. Proper understanding of the climate and issuing weather forecast based on the dynamic nature of atmosphere would help in multiple ways. Four different weather forecasts are presently made. They are now casting, short range, medium range and long range. Among the forecasts, the weather forecast given under medium range seems to serve the purpose of the farmers, since it provides enough time to the farmers to change the agricultural operations based on anticipated weather change under dry land environment. In this context, a project on the establishment of National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (NCMRWF) and Development of Agro-meteorological service was approved by the Government of India and implemented by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) in mission mode. Currently local weather forecast based on Direct Model output of General Circulation Model (GCM) is prepared by NCMRWF and given to Agromet Advisory Service units located at different State Agricultural Universities (SAU) including seven in Tamil Nadu, four under TNAU (Coimbatore, Pechiparai, Kovilpatti and Aduthurai) and two under Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Chennai and Namakkal) and one at Kannivadi (MSSRF). In turn the SAU prepares weather based agro advisory bulletin and communicate to the farmers for making decisions on agricultural activities based on anticipated weather change. The forecast covers, cloud cover, rainfall, wind speed, wind direction, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. This forecast is 438 given for four days from Tuesday to Friday and again from Friday to Monday and thus it covers a whole week. Presently TNAU installs Automatic Weather Station at block level and once completed, block level weather forecast with agro advisories will be given. 9. Seasonal climate forecast Seasonal climate forecast is being given to all districts of Tamil Nadu through TNAU Research Stations both for South-west and North-east monsoon seasons with a lead time of 15 days. This forecast contains the seasonal rainfall both in temporal and spatial dimensions. This forecast is based on probability analysis made through Australian Rainman Software. The inputs are location specific past rainfall data more than twenty one years and real time southern oscillation index and sea surface temperature.

The inputs are location specific past rainfall data more than twenty one years and real time southern oscillation index and sea surface temperature. This type of forecast is being given from 1999 onwards and presently institutionalized by the TNAU. Based on the verification of the forecast, the accuracy goes up to 70 per cent. Since the forecast is given with a lead time the information is highly useful for farm planning and hence it becomes response farming in nature. 10. Climate change and crop production a) Model result on Temperature and Rainfall The results of the projected climate change over Cauvery basin of Tamil Nadu for A1B scenario using PRECIS and RegCM3 regional climate models showed an increasing trend for maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall. Decadal means of maximum and minimum temperatures were generated to understand the variation more clearly and the results revealed that the increase in maximum temperature in PRECIS was 3.7oC and in RegCM3, it was 3.1oC. The increase in minimum temperature in PRECIS model was 4.2oC and in RegCM3, it was 3.7oC during the same period. The increase in minimum temperatures is higher than maximum temperatures in both models. b) Model result on rice productivity The study on the yield of ADT 43 rice over Cauvery Delta Zone as simulated by Decision support System for Agricultural technology Transfer (DSSAT) under CO2 fertilization, the result had shown that a reduction of 135 Kg ha-1 decade-1 for PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) model, while there was an increase in yield of24 Kg ha-1 decade-1 for RegCM3 (Regional Climate Model System 3) model, thus indicating the possibility of change in rice yield under climate change scenario. c) Impact of Climate change on crops Analysis on the maize crop yield indicated reduction in yield by 3.0, 9.3 and 18.3 per cent respectively during 2020, 2050 and 2080 from the current yield levels in the major maize growing districts of Tamil Nadu with increase in minimum temperature. Sorghum crop yield is expected to decline by 4.5, 11.2 and 18.7 per cent during 2020, 439 2050 and 2080 from the current yield levels if no management intervention is made in the major sorghum growing districts of Tamil Nadu. This is due to nighttime temperature increase. d)", "source": "crop_production_guide.pdf"}

Integration of Integrated Vector Management (IVM) is done by using identical vector control methods top control malaria and lieshmaniasis in rural areas, and malaria and dengue in urban areas to achieve cost-effectiveness and synergy. The measures of vector control and protection include: 1. Measures to control adult mosquitoes: Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) 2. Anti-larval measures: chemical, biological and environmental 3. Personal protection: use of bed nets, including insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and Long Lasting Treated Nets (LLINs) The national malaria control program is currently using IRS as the primarily method of vector control in rural settings, and anti-larval measures in the urban areas. Insecticides like DDT, Malathion and Synthetic Pyrethroids are recommended in the programme for IRS. The state health services will be responsible for safe disposal of DDT and other insecticides. General safety precautions while handling insecticides and guidelines for proper storage, transportation and safe disposal of insecticides and insecticide containers are mentioned below for further reference. General safety precautions while handling insecticides Exposure to insecticides may occur when handling and spraying insecticides. The exposures to insecticides may occur in following situations: \uf0b7 When handling the insecticide product during opening of the package, mixing and preparation of the spray. \uf0b7 When spraying the insecticide. \uf0b7 When disposing the insecticide solution and containers General precautions: 1. The operator should also wear a protective hat and face shield or goggles. 2. Do not eat, drink or smoke while working. 3. Wash hands and face with soap and water after spraying and before eating, smoking or drinking. 4. Shower or bath at the end of every day(cid:146)s work and wear new clean clothes. 5. Wash overalls and other protective clothing at the end of every working day in soap and water and keep them separate from the rest of the family(cid:146)s clothes. 6. If the insecticide touches the skin, wash off immediately with soap and water. 7. Change clothes immediately if they become contaminated with insecticides. 8.

Change clothes immediately if they become contaminated with insecticides. 8. Inform the supervisor immediately if one feels unwell. Protective clothing and equipment Absorption of insecticide occurs mainly through the skin, lungs and mouth. Specific protective clothing and equipment given below must be worn in accordance with the safety instructions on the product label \u25cf Broad-rimmed hat (protects head, face and neck from spray droplets). \u25cf Face-shield or goggles (protects face and eyes against spray fall-out). \u25cf Face mask (protects nose and mouth from airborne particles). \u25cf Long-sleeved overalls (worn outside of boots). \u25cf Rubber gloves. \u25cf Boots. Storage 1. Insecticide storehouses must be located away from areas where people or animals are housed and away from water sources, wells, and canals. 2. They should be located on high ground and fenced, with access only for authorized persons. However, there should be easy access for insecticide delivery vehicles and, ideally access on at least three sides of the building for fire-fighting vehicles and equipment in case of emergency. 3. Insecticides must NOT be kept where they would be exposed to sunlight, water, or moisture which could affect their stability. 4. Storehouses should be secure and well ventilated. 5. Containers, bags or boxes should be well stacked to avoid possibility of spillage. The principle of (cid:145)first expiry first out(cid:146) should be followed. 6. Stock and issue registers should be kept upto date. Access to the insecticides should be limited to authorized personnel only. 7. The store room should have a prominently displayed mark of caution used for poisonous or hazardous substances. It should be kept locked. 8. Containers should be arranged to minimize handling and thus avoid mechanical damage which could give rise to leaks. Containers and cartons should be stacked safely, with the height of stacks limited to ensure stability. Transportation 1. Insecticides should be transported in well sealed and labeled containers, boxes or bags. 2. Insecticides should be transported separately. It should NOT be transported in the same vehicle as items such as agricultural produce, food, clothing, drugs, toys, and cosmetics that could become hazardous if contaminated. 3. Pesticide containers should be loaded in such a way that they will not be damaged during transport, their labels will not be rubbed off", "source": "Guidelines-Proper-Storage-Safe-handling-Disposal-Insecticides.pdf"}

Pesticide containers should be loaded in such a way that they will not be damaged during transport, their labels will not be rubbed off and they will not shift and fall off the transport vehicle onto rough road surfaces. 4. Vehicles transporting pesticides should carry prominently displayed warning notices. 5. The pesticide load should be checked at intervals during transportation, and any leaks, spills, or other contamination should be cleaned up immediately using accepted standard procedures. In the event of leakage while the transport vehicle is moving, the vehicle should be brought to a halt immediately so that the leak can be stopped and the leaked product cleaned up. Containers should be inspected upon arrival at the receiving station. There should be official reports to the national level and follow-up enquiries in the event of fires, spills, poisonings, and other hazardous events. Disposal of remains of insecticides and empty packaging 1. At the end of the day(cid:146)s work during IRS activities, the inside of the spray pump should be washed and any residual insecticide should be flushed from the lance and nozzle. 2. The rinsing water should be collected and carefully contained in clearly marked drums with a tightly fitted lid. This should be used to dilute the next day(cid:146)s tank loads or disposed properly by the supervisor at disposal sites like pits or digs. 3. Never pour the remaining insecticide into rivers, pools or drinking-water sources. 4. Decontaminate containers where possible. For glass, plastic or metal containers this can be achieved by triple rinsing, i.e. part-filling the empty container with water three times and emptying into a bucket or sprayer for the next application. 5. All empty packaging should be returned to the supervisor for safe disposal according to national guidelines. 6. Never re-use empty insecticide containers. 7. It shall be the duty of manufacturers, formulators of insecticides and operators to dispose packages or surplus materials and washing in a safe manner so as to prevent environmental or water pollution. 8. The used packages shall not be left outside to prevent their re-use. 9. The packages shall be broken and buried away from habitation. Disposal of Expired Insecticides 1.

For development of neural network based forecast models, yields of crop at district level (Uttar Pradesh state, India) was considered as output variable and indices of weather variables viz. maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall and morning relative humidity were considered as input variables. Forecasts based on MLP architecture using Conjugate gradient descent algorithm for learning have been found to be close to the observed ones in most of the cases. The findings of the study substantiates that neural networks possess potential for prediction purposes. Key words: Neural network; Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP); Crop yield forecasting; Weather variables ________________________________________________________________________ 1 Introduction Reliable and timely forecasts provide important and useful input for proper, foresighted and informed planning, more so, in agriculture which is full of uncertainties. Agriculture now-a-days has become highly input and cost intensive. Without judicious use of fertilizers and plant protection measures, agriculture no longer remains as profitable as before. Uncertainties of weather, production, policies, prices, etc. often lead to losses to the farmers. Under the changed scenario today, forecasting of various aspects relating to agriculture are becoming essential. But in-spite of strong need for reliable and timely forecasts, the current status is far from satisfactory. Weather variability both within and between seasons is uncontrollable source of variability in yields. The impact of weather 56 RATNA RAJ LAXMI AND AMRENDER KUMAR [Vol.9, Nos. 1&2 and climate on food production is of vital importance. Weather variables affect the crop differently during different stages of development. Thus extent of weather influence on crop yield depends not only on the magnitude of weather variables but also on the distribution pattern of weather over the crop season. Thus there is need to develop statistically sound objective forecasts of crop yield based on weather variables so that reliable forecasts can be obtained.

Most of the earlier workers have utilised regression models (taking data as such or suitable transformation of data or some indices), discriminant function analysis, agro-meteorological models, etc. for crop yield forecasting (to cite a few, Choudhary and Sarkar (1981), Agrawal et al. (1986), Prasad and Dudhane (1989), Kumar and Bhar (2005). Recently, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has received a great deal of attention, because complicated problems can be treated by this even if the data are imprecise and noisy. Preliminary work on ANNs has been done by many workers, Cheng and Titterington (1994) made a detailed study of ANN models vis-a-vis traditional statistical models. They have shown that some statistical procedures including regression, principal component analysis, density function and statistical image analysis can be given neural network expressions. Warner and Misra (1996) reviewed the relevant literature on neural networks, explained the learning algorithm and made a comparison between regression and neural network models in terms of notations, terminologies and implementation. Kaastra and Boyd (1996) developed neural network model for forecasting financial and economic time series. Dewolf and Francl (1997,200) demonstrated the applicability of neural network technology for plant diseases forecasting. Zhang et al. (1998) provided the general summary of the work in ANN forecasting, providing the guidelines for neural network modeling, general paradigm of the ANNs especially those used for forecasting. They have reviewed the relative performance of ANNs with the traditional statistical methods, wherein in most of the studies ANNs were found to be better than the latter. Chakraborty et al. (1998) utilized the ANN technique for predicted severity of anthracnose diseases in legume crop. Gaudart et al. (2004) compared the performance of Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and that of linear regression for epidemiological data with regard to quality of prediction and robustness to deviation from underlying assumptions of normality, homoscedasticity and independence of errors and it was found that MLP performed better than linear regression. ANNs are data driven self adaptive methods in that there are a few prior assumptions about the models for problems under study. On the basis of examples, subtle functional relationalships among the data are captured even if the underlying relationships are unknown or hard to describe. ANNs can identify and learn correlated patterns between input data sets and corresponding target values through training.", "source": "rain.pdf"}

ANNs can identify and learn correlated patterns between input data sets and corresponding target values through training. After training, ANNs can be used to predict the outcome of new independent input data and have great capacity in predictive modelling, i.e. all the characters describing the unknown situation can be presented to the trained ANNs, and then prediction of agricultural system may be feasible. In this article, an attempt has been 2011] FORECASTING MODEL FOR CROPS YIELD 57 made to study application of artificial neural networks for crops (rice, wheat and sugarcane) yield forecasting using weather variables for various districts of Uttar Pradesh. 2 Materials and Methods Models for forecasting crop yields based on weather parameters utilize data for past several years for a location. Crop yield in different years is affected by technological change and weather variability. It can be assumed that the technological factors will increase yield smoothly through time and, therefore, years or some other parameter of time can be used to study the overall effect of technology on yield. Weather variability both within and between seasons is uncontrollable source of variability in yields. Weather variables affect the crop differently during different stages of development. Thus extent of weather influence on crop yield depends not only on the magnitude of weather variables but also on the distribution pattern of weather over the crop season which, as such, calls for the necessity of dividing the whole crop season into fine intervals and studying the relationship in these periods. This will increase number of variables in the model and in turn a large number of model parameters will have to be evaluated from the data. This will require a long series of data for precise estimation of the parameters which may not be available in practice. Thus, a technique based on relatively smaller number of manageable parameters and at the same time taking care of entire weather distribution may solve the problem. District-wise data on productivity in respect of the crops (rice, wheat and sugarcane) from 1970-71 to 2000-01 were obtained from Directorate of Agriculture, U.P. Weekly data on weather variables for Allahabad, Varanasi, Ballia, Lucknow, Fatehpur, Hardoi, Banda and Jalaun from 1970 onwards were procured from", "source": "rain.pdf"}

Weekly data on weather variables for Allahabad, Varanasi, Ballia, Lucknow, Fatehpur, Hardoi, Banda and Jalaun from 1970 onwards were procured from India Meteorological Department whereas for Kanpur, Jhansi and Faizabad data were obtained from Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad. For this study, weather data on maximum & minimum temperature, morning relative humidity and rainfall (MAXT, MINT, RHI and RF) were considered. For each agro-climatic zone, data for all districts were taken together. For development of forecast models weekly weather data for rice and wheat whereas for sugarcane fortnightly data were used. As weather during pre- sowing period is important for establishment of the crop, data starting from two weeks before sowing have been included in model development (for rice and wheat). Further, as the objective was to forecast yield well in advance of harvest, weather data till about 2\u00bd months before harvesting have been considered. Therefore, for rice, weather data from 23rd standard meteorological week (smw) to 35th smw, for wheat data from 40th smw to 52nd smw and for sugarcane data from 2nd fortnight of March to 2nd fortnight of September were used for development of models. Models utilized weekly weather data for rice and wheat whereas for sugarcane fortnightly data were considered. In this study, 58 RATNA RAJ LAXMI AND AMRENDER KUMAR [Vol. 9, Nos. 1&2 models were developed through weather indices (WI) based regression approach and artificial neural networks approach using Multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture with different learning algorithm viz.

The first index represents the total amount of weather parameter received by the crop during the period under consideration while the other one takes care of distribution of weather parameter with special reference to its importance in different weeks in relation to the variable to forecast. On similar lines, indices were computed with products of weather variables (taken two at a time) for joint effects (Agrawal et al. (1986) and Agrawal and Mehta (2007)). 2.2 Multilayer perceptron artificial neural network Multilayer perceptron technique is very popular and is used more often than other neural network types. MLP is neural network in which the non-linear elements (neurons) are arranged in successive layers, and the information flows uni-directionally from input layer to output layer through hidden layer(s). MLP architecture can have a number of hidden layers with a variable number of hidden units per layer. The network thus has a simple interpretation as a form of input-output model, with weights and thresholds (biases) as free parameters of the model. Such networks can model functions of almost arbitrary complexity, with the number of layers, and the number of units in each layer, determining the function complexity. In a training of the network, through learning algorithm, produces its own output and tries to minimize the discrepancies between its own output and the target output. The minimization of discrepancies is done by weight adjustment during the learning phase. In this study, different learning algorithm viz. Backpropagation, Levenberg - Marquardt and Conjugate gradient descent were used for minimize the discrepancies between its own output and the target output. Neural network models with different hidden layers (one & two) and different number of neurons (4, 5 and 6) in a hidden layer with hyperbolic tangent(tanh) function as activation function i.e. f(x) = (exp(x)\u2212exp(\u2212x))/(exp(x)+exp(\u2212x)) 2011] FORECASTING MODEL FOR CROPS YIELD 59 with varying learning rate, were obtained and selected the best architecture, which having lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Therefore, in the present study, hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function has been used as activation function for neural networks model based on MLP architecture. 2.3 Partition of data For models development, data set is divided into three distinct sets called training, testing and validation sets. The training set is the largest set and is used by neural network to learn patterns present in the data. In a training of the network, through different learning algorithm viz. Backpropagation, Levenberg - Marquardt and Conjugate gradient descent were used for the detecting the pattern in the data. The testing set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of a supposedly trained network. A final check on the performance of the trained network is made using validation set. 2.4 Learning algorithm 2.4.1 Back propagation algorithm Backpropagation is the most commonly used method for training multilayered feed- forward networks. It can be applied to any feed-forward network with differentiable activation functions. For most networks, the learning process is based on a suitable error function, which is then minimized with respect to the weights and bias. If a network has differential activation functions, then the activations of the output units become differentiable functions of input variables, the weights and bias. If we also define a differentiable error function of the network outputs such as the sum of square error function, then the error function itself is a differentiable function of the weights. Therefore, we can evaluate the derivative of the error with respect to weights, and these derivatives can then be used to find the weights that minimize the error function by either using optimization method. The algorithm for evaluating the derivative of the error function is known as backpropagation, because it propagates the errors backward through the network. Multilayer feed forward neural network or multilayered perceptron (MLP), is very popular and is used more than other neural network type for a wide variety of tasks. MLP learned by backpropagation algorithm is based on supervised procedure, i.e. the network constructs a model based on examples of data with known output. The Backpropagation Learning Algorithm is based on an error correction learning rule and specifically on the minimization of the mean squared error that is", "source": "rain.pdf"}

The Backpropagation Learning Algorithm is based on an error correction learning rule and specifically on the minimization of the mean squared error that is a measure of the 60 RATNA RAJ LAXMI AND AMRENDER KUMAR [Vol. 9, Nos. 1&2 difference between the actual and the desired output. As all multilayer feedforward networks, the multilayer perceptrons are constructed of at least three layers (one input layer, one or more hidden layers and one output layer), each layer consisting of elementary processing units (artificial neurons), which incorporate a nonlinear activation function, commonly the logistic sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent(tanh) function. The algorithm calculates the difference between the actual response and the desired output of each neuron of the output layer of the network. Assuming that y(n) is the actual j output of the jth neuron of the output layer at the iteration n and d j (n) is the corresponding desired output, the error signal e(n) is defined as: j e (n) = d (n)\u2212 y (n) j j j The instantaneous value of the error for the neuron j is defined as e 2(n)/2and j correspondingly, the instantaneous total error E(n) is obtained by summing the neural error e 2(n)/2 over all neurons in the output layer. Thus, j 1 E(n) = \u2211 e 2(n) 2 j j In the above formula, j runs over all the neurons of the output layer. If we define N to be the total number of training patterns that consist the training set applied to the neural network during the training process, then the average squared error E is obtained by av summing E(n) over all the training patterns and then normalizing with respect to the size N of the training set. Thus, 1 N \u2211 E = E(n). av 2 n=1 It is obvious, that the instantaneous error E(n), as well as the average squared error E , is av a function of all the free parameters of the network.

The \u03b4 tell us by how much we should change our network weights to achieve a (possibly) better solution. The JtJ matrix can also be known as the approximated Hessian. The \u03bb damping factor is adjusted at each iteration, and guides the optimization process. If reduction of E is rapid, a smaller value can be used, bringing the algorithm closer to the Gauss\u2013Newton algorithm, whereas if iteration gives insufficient reduction in the residual, \u03bb can be increased, giving a step closer to the gradient descent direction. This algorithm requires computation of the Jacobian J matrix at each iteration step and the inversion of JtJ square matrix, the dimension of which is N\u00b4N. This is the reason why for large size neural networks the LM algorithm is not practical. 2.4.3 Conjugate gradient descent algorithm The back-propagation (BP) training algorithm is a supervised learning method for multi- layered feed-forward neural networks. It is essentially a gradient descent local optimization technique which involves backward error correction of network weights. Despite the general success of back-propagation method in the learning process, it has a number of serious drawbacks. Firstly, it is required to select three arbitrary coefficients: learning rate, momentum, and the number of hidden nodes. An unfortunate choice could cause slow convergence. Secondly, the network may become trapped in a local minimum", "source": "rain.pdf"}

Firstly, it is required to select three arbitrary coefficients: learning rate, momentum, and the number of hidden nodes. An unfortunate choice could cause slow convergence. Secondly, the network may become trapped in a local minimum of the error function, resulting in an unacceptable solution. Finally, it requires a large number of iterations to optimally adjust the network weights, hence it becomes unsuitable for large problems. Numerical optimization theory such as conjugate gradient offers a rich and robust set of techniques, which can be applied to train neural networks. These techniques not only focus on the local gradient of the error function, but also make use of its second derivative. The first derivative measures the slope of the error surface at a point, while the second measures the curvature of the error surface at the same point. This information is very important for determining the optimal update direction. As these methods make use of the second derivatives of the function to be optimized, they are typically referred to as second-order methods which also reduced the training time for feedforward neural networks (Barnard, 1992 and Johansson et al., 1992). Hence, the Conjugate gradient learning algorithm is another alternative procedure to overcome these problems faced by back-propagation (BP) training and Levenberg Marquardt algorithm algorithm.

This application software was developed to recommend fertilizer doses for the targeted yield at the district level. This system has the facility to input actual soil test values at the farmers\u2019 fields to obtain optimum doses of fertilizers. The application is a user-friendly tool. It will aid to the farmer in improving the efficiency (appropriate dose) of fertilizer use to achieve a specific crop yield. The system is explained with the example of Tamil Nadu. The system works as a ready reckonner to give prescription in the form of fertilizer available (eg. Urea, SSP, MOP etc). Performance results This decision support system provides real use of fertility maps to the users. It can be used up to field level, if the farmer has the knowledge of his field fertility status and the yield target. It can be further narrowed down to block/village level depending on the availability of information. The experiments conducted at different locations in the states suggest that a considerable amount of fertilizer can be saved, if the fertilizers are prescribed using soil-test values.

Performance results Tested and validated over one year with different soils with minimum 80 % accuracy. Cost of technology Maximum s30,000 with complete package of soil-testing. Impact and benefits In view of the ever-expanding multi-nutrient deficiencies in soils, site specific nutrient management, which is considered as Fertilizer Best Management Practice, needs to be promoted to improve soil health and crop productivity. Inadequate and unreliable soil-testing facilities, poor awareness of farmers about balanced plant nutrition and lack of appropriate policy are the major constraints in adoption of Fertilizer Best Management Practices. It is realized that the soil-testing service has not made the desired impact and farmers have not yet been able to adopt it in large numbers. On the other hand, on-station and on-farm experiments conducted under diverse agro-ecologies across the country established the significance of soil-test based balanced fertilizer use in improving crop yields and nutrient use efficiency. Compared with farmers\u2019 fertilizer practice, 20-25% yield gain could be easily obtained with the adoption of soil-test based recommendations, although much greater advantages are also reported depending on soil conditions and crops/cropping systems. The Pusa STFR Meter would increase farmers\u2019 access to soil testing, and thus help them to achieve higher yields owing to soil test based fertilizer application.

In Fe rich soils, only two foliar sprays are enough to enrich the grains with Fe. \u2022 In pulse crops (chick pea and pigeon pea), 25% defoliation or nipping at bud before flowering along with one spray either at flowering or pod formation stage has proved to be effective in enhancing grain Fe concentration. Performance results \u2022 One foliar spray along with 25% defoliation is best strategy for enhancing Fe content in chick pea (17-25%) while nipping is the best strategy to enhance Fe content in pigeon pea grain (24-32.8%). \u2022 Fe concentration in grains of rice and maize can be increased by 9-23% with the application of ferrous sulphate @ 50 kg ha-1 along with two foliar sprays at pre- and post- anthesis. Cost of technology \u2022 Cost of Fe enrichment varies with crop, the soil types, amount of fertilizer used and method of fertilizer application. \u2022 Manual nipping and defoliation enhances the cost but new machinery may be useful in minimizing labour cost on such intervention. On an average, cost of Fe enrichment varies between 21,500 and 3,500/ha. \u2022 Output also varies with crop response to fertilization. On average, output range between 27,000 and 20,000/ha. Impact and benefits This strategy is considered as a relatively low cost, highly efficient and safer than diet supplementation approaches in prevention of nutritional deficiencies to combat dietary mineral inadequacies in rural areas. Fe bio-fortified products appear to be better sources of potentially bioavailable Fe in comparison with the non-fortified analogues.

Seed Coating: zinc oxide/ Teprosyn-Zn/ zinc phosphate slurry Root dipping: zinc oxide/ zinc phosphate Basal application : zinc sulphate @ 5.0 kg Zn ha-1 sufficient for 2-3 crop cycles (rate varied with crops and soils) or 4-5t FYM+2.5 kg Zn ha-1 or Top dressing : zinc sulphate (if not applied as basal) Foliar application : 0.5 to 2.0% zinc sulphate (supplement to basal application) Performance results \u2022 Use of Zn in balanced fertilization improved yield of different crops to a tune of 10-35% depending upon soil types, severity of deficiency, crops etc. \u2022 Application of Zn alone contributes about 25 million tonne of total food grain production. It sustained the productivity over the years. \u2022 The National Food Security Mission has adopted the Zn in fertilization package and provides a subsidy of R500 ha-1 for Zn fertilizer to each crop. Cost of technology Cost of Zn application varies with amount of Zn fertilizer used and labour required. On an average, cost of Zn fertilizer use varies between R500 and 2,000 ha-1. Output also varied with crop response to fertilization. On average, output range between .1,000 and 20,000ha-1. Impact and benefits Application of zinc enchances crop yield and profit by 10-35% and can has the potential to contribute 25 million tonnes of food grain production.

Pyrite, a good source of S should be applied in moist soil through surface broadcast before one month of planting to meet S requirement of the crops. \u2022 Basal application of S sources is beneficial, however, it can be used at 25-30 days crop growth stages in case of oilseeds. \u2022 The recommendations/technology options developed for correction of S deficiency for different crops/ cropping systems are: \u2022 Rice-wheat cropping system : 30 kg S ha-1 in each crop 45 kg S ha-1 to rice \u2022 Other cereal based cropping system(s) : 30- 45 kg S ha-1 \u2022 Pulse-based cropping system(s) : 35-45 kg S ha-1 \u2022 Oilseeds-based cropping system(s) : 45-60 kg S ha-1 \u2022 Sugarcane : 80 kg ha-1 \u2022 Green gram/Black gram/Lentil : 30 kg S ha-1 5 Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource Management Performance results \u2022 More than 40 crops responded to S application in S deficient soils in more than 140 districts of the country. \u2022 The yield advantage due to S application over NPK recorded from 10 to 30% in cereals, 15-40% in pulses and 15-45% in oilseeds. The additional net profit obtained with S application varied from R5,000 to R39,000 per hectare. \u2022 Long-term experiments showed sustainable yield trend with NPKS fertilization schedule and utilization efficiency of NPK increased with inclusion of S in fertilization schedule.

Performance results \u2022 Different crops and cropping systems, especially wheat performed tremendously with application of Mn in deficient soils. \u2022 Application of Mn enhances the farmers profit by 10-35% depending upon crop type and crop response to Mn fertilization. \u2022 Replenishment of Mn improves the fertility and soil health, and also increases the utilization of other macronutrients, reducing leaching losses and thus helpful in saving environment. Cost of technology Cost of Mn application varies with amount of fertilizer used and labour required. Foliar spray enhances labour cost. On average, cost of micronutrient fertilizer use varied between R700 and 2,000 ha-1. Output also varies with crop response to fertilization. On average, output ranges between R2,500 and 15,000 ha-1.

To maintain the moisture, curing materials should be covered with a polythene sheet/gunny bags. Quality improvement of the final product results because of the change of following characteristics over normal farm compost:- \u2022 Stabilization of C:N ratio around 10.0 to12:1 \u2022 pH stabilizes around neutral (7 to 7.5) \u2022 CEC of final product increases above 25% \u2022 Microbial carbon increases more than 100 times. \u2022 Viable population of Azospirillum/ Azotobacter and PSB increases 300-400 times and six times, respectively. Performance results \u2022 Use of bio-enriched compost @ 1 tonne/ha could minimize the recommended nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizer to 50% without any yield loss of crops grown in rice- toria and rice- wheat sequence. \u2022 Biofertilizers with increased dose of compost @ 2 tonne/ha, more specifically enriched compost could reduce recommended N, P fertilizer up to 75% in subsequent year due to cumulative effects of INM package. Cost of technology Preparation of Bio-enriched compost involves modest additional cost of the price of low grade Rock Phosphate and biofertilizer over that of normal compost. Every tonne of Bio-enriched compost requires around 170 kg rock phosphate and 10 kg of Azospirillum/ Azotobacter and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) biofertilizer. Considering the cost of Rock Phosphate R3/ kg and biofertilizer R75/ kg, additional cost for each tonne of Bio-enriched compost preparation is about R2,000/ only. Impact and benefits Incorporation of enriched compost with subsequent reduction of fertilizers (N, P) showed improved soil health. Huge amount of foreign exchange can be saved for importing chemical fertilzers.

Therefore, addition of one tonne (1,000 kg) of enriched compost 2 will substitute about 14-15 kg of N, 50-60 kg of P O and 25-30 kg of KO, respectively. 2 5 2 Cost of technology ]2,00,000 Impact and benefits Enriched compost would reduce dependence on costly phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. Hence, it will reduce cost of cultivation in one hand and increase income of the farmers on the other. Large quantities of crop residues may be recycled back to the field after converting them into quality manure. Substantial amounts of rock phosphate and waste mica may be recycled in agriculture as a source of phosphorus and potassium and thus lead to the utilization of indigenous mineral resources. Huge amount of foreign exchange can be saved partly or wholly on import of costly P and K fertilizers.

Salient features \u2022 Phosphorus is considered to be one of the major nutrient elements limiting agricultural production in acidic soils. Phosphate solubilizing fungi (PSF) play an important role in supplementing phosphorus from insoluble phosphate source to the plants. \u2022 Easy multiplication of PSF for application in phosphate deficient soils. It also increases plant growth, induces resistance and control soil borne phytopathogens like Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Sclerotium and Sclerotinia. \u2022 The Trichoderma and Penicillium based formulations, respectively, have 50-67 and 40-45% phosphate solubilising potential on inorganic insoluble source of phosphate like ferric phosphate and tricalcium phosphate. Performance results The technology is cost effective and easy to apply in the acidic soils. Cost of technology R400.0 per ha (or) R100 per kg. Impact and benefits Adoption of technology leads to enhanced (i) phosphorus availability, (ii) growth promotion and (iii) biological disease management in acidic soils.

For vermicomposting, open permanent pits of 102 ft \u00d7 32 ft \u00d7 22 ft dimensions are made under the shade of a tree at an elevated place, about 2 feet above the ground to avoid entry of rainwater into the pits. Brick walls are constructed above the floor of the pits leaving 5-6 gaps in the pit wall of 10 cm dia to facilitate aeration. These holes are blocked with nylon screen (100 mesh) to prevent escape of earthworms from the pits. 3-4 cm thick layer of partially decomposed dung (about 2-month-old) is spread on the bottom of the pits. A layer of litter/residue and dung in the ratio of 1:1 (w/w) is then added. A second layer of dung is then applied followed by another layer of litter/crop residue in the same ratio up to", "source": "Soil Management.pdf"}

A second layer of dung is then applied followed by another layer of litter/crop residue in the same ratio up to a height of 2 feet. Two species of epigeic earthworms viz., Eisenia foetida and Perionyx excavatus are inoculated in the pits or heaps. Watering by sprinkler is done intermittently. Moisture content is maintained at 60-70% throughout the composting period. Jute bags (gunny bags) are spread uniformly on the surface to facilitate maintenance of suitable moisture regime and temperature. The material is allowed to decompose for 15-20 days to stabilize the temperature after the initial thermophilic stage. Earthworms were then inoculated in the pit @ 10 adult earthworms per kg of waste material and a total of 5,000 worms were added to each pit or heap. The materials were allowed to decompose for 110 days. The forest litter decomposes faster (75 to 85 days) than farm residues (110-115 days). In the heap method the waste materials and partially decomposed dung (1:1 w/w) are made out into heaps of 10 feet length \u00d7 3 feet width \u00d7 2 feet high and during inoculation, channels are made by hand and earthworm @ 1 kg per quintal of waste are inoculated and then watering is done by sprinkling. Pieces of jute cloth are used as covering material. Performance results Under organic farming systems, combined application of cattle dung manure (2 t/ha) + Vermicompost (1.5 tonne/ha) and poultry manure (1.5 tonne/ha) + biofertilizer @5kg/ha sustained the productivity of soybean, chick pea and mustard and isabgol crops as well as biological health of soil. Cost of technology About 3 tonnes of vermicompost can be produced from 10 beds of 10 ft \u00d7 3 ft \u00d7 2 ft each. The cost of earthworms is .400-500 per kg. A 50-kg bag of vermicompost can be sold for .150 (.3,000/tonne). Basically, vermicompost is used like any other manure: .5,000 kg/ha in cropping and 1-10 kg/ tree in plantations, depending on the size of tree. Impact and benefits This technology is better in terms of faster decomposition of the waste over conventional method. Secondly the nutrient composition of the vermicompost is superior over conventional compost.

More often there exists a mismatch between the farmers\u2019 resources and farmers\u2019 practices. Therefore a need was felt for participatory nutrient management at farmers\u2019 fields. Seven Integrated nutrient management modules were tested for two years at the institute for their effectiveness vis a vis farmers resources. Two best modules are very suitable for upscaling. These are: i) Balanced Fertilization (BF) i.e. 100% Recommended rate of N, P, K, S, Zn to soybean and 100% recommended rate of NPKS to wheat; ii) Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) ie. 50% Recommended rate of NPKS + 5 t FYM/ha +Rhizobium to soybean and 75% of Recommended rate of NPKS + PSB to wheat. Performance results The INM technology i.e. 50% NPKS+5t FYM+ Rhizobium to soybean and 75%NPKS+PSB to wheat produced 24-60% higher soybean \u2013 wheat productivity. Similarly balanced fertilization also improved the soybean and wheat yield by 23- 30 per cent. The choice between the two technologies depended upon the availability of FYM with the farmers. Cost of technology Total cost of INM and balanced fertilizer application was R21,621 and R 22,668/ha. However, the net returns were R61,240 and R60,342/ha respectively.

BBF are made with a tractor drawn BBF former. On BBF, sole maize or intercropping of pigeon pea with maize crop in rainy season and chick pea in the winter can be grown with application of recommended doses of fertilizer and Luxurious growth of maize crop on BBF farmyard manure @ 5 tonne/ha. Two rows of maize at 60 cm interval or two rows of maize intercropped with one row of pigeon pea could be sown on a bed and four rows of chickpea at an interval of 30 cm could be grown on a bed in winter. The BBF system is particularly suitable for the Vertisols. The technique works best on deep black soils in areas with intense rainfall averaging 750 mm or more per annum. Performance results The BBF system reduced the runoff (20-24%) and consequent soil losses (30-45%) from the Vertisols. It increased the amount of water that infiltrates in the profile by increasing the opportunity time of water to infiltrate and also increases storage of water in the profile for their use by crops during the dry spell. When rainfall is very heavy, the furrows safely carry runoff water away without causing excess soil loss and drain the excess water to the water harvesting ponds which is used for irrigating chickpea during the winter season. BBF also makes heavy soils more workable by improving drainage and extending the opportunity time for infiltration. The package gave a yield advantage of 20-25% on soybean-equivalent weight basis over soybean-chickpea system grown on traditional flat on grade system. Cost of technology Only the additional cost of the BBF maker and tropiculter (in lieu of seed drill) each costing .50,000 is involved for adoption of this technology, which is a one-time investment for a span of around 10 years. Impact and benefits The technological package gives a yield advantage of 20-25% over traditional flat on grade system. This will add to the income of a farmer proportionally.

The residue so left in the field cannot be utilized for any of the traditional uses, the common practice in vogue is to burn the residues in the field itself to facilitate easy land preparation for the succeeding kharif crop. The field burning of crop residues is undoubtedly a wasteful practice as it results in loss of valuable organic matter, and associated nutrients. Soil microbial population in surface layer may also get affected. A suitable alternative residue management strategy has been developed at the Indian Institute of Soil Science, Bhopal through years of experimentation. The technology of crop residue management involves soil incorporation of wheat residue plus N supplementation through FYM@ 28 kg N ha-1 (approx. 4 t FYM ha-1) along with 25 kg P ha-1 for rainfed soybean and 68 kg N + 30 kg P ha-1 for irrigated (1+ 2 irrigations) wheat is more effective and profitable. Performance results \u2022 Wheat residue incorporation or retention coupled with application of 28 kg N ha-1 through fertilizer or organic manures is more beneficial than burning in terms of enhanced crop productivity and soil fertility. \u2022 Wheat residue incorporation resulted in 20\u201322% higher yields in soybean and 15-25% in wheat as compared to residue burning. \u2022 Compared to residue burning, the residue incorporation or surface retention caused a marked improvement in the soil organic carbon content. Irrespective of residue management option, the N supply through organic sources led to an appreciable increase in soil organic carbon. \u2022 Available P and K status of soil improved with residue incorporation and residue surface retention. Further, the residue incorporation/ retention improved soil physical health in terms of a decrease in soil bulk density and an increase in the percentage water-stable aggregates and mean weight diameter.

However, it could be successfully grown in the agricultural fields at a shallow water depth of 40-45 cm. Besides makhana, main food crops like paddy and wheat and forage crop- Barseem could be cultivated in the same field during the year. \u2022 On average, 4-5 months are sufficient for makhana cultivation and other crops could be cultivated during rest of the months. Performance results \u2022 In general, makhana is transplanted in the second week of April and harvested by the second week of August. Thereafter, short duration varieties of rice are cultivated in the same field. Wheat is sown by mid December and harvested by the second week of April, and the field is prepared for the subsequent crop of makhana. Hence, cultivation of three crops per year is possible from the same field. \u2022 Makhana based different cropping system include: makhana-Water chestnut; makhana-barseem; makhana-rice; and makhana-rice-wheat. Cost of technology \u2022 Makhana, followed by water chestnut- R56,000 per ha; makhana, followed by barseem- R47,500 per ha, and makhana, followed by rice and wheat R77,000 per ha.

This technology increases the grain production, improves quality of grain, and results in higher income. Performance results Grassy and broad-leaved weeds in wheat have been reported to cause 30-50% yield loss. As a result, the growth of the crop is adversely suppressed, and the crop productivity is reduced significantly. However, continuous use of the same herbicide may result in development of resistant biotypes. This calls for use of other competitive herbicides for weed management to avoid shift in the weed flora. The overall net return with the adoption of herbicides for weed control in wheat is to the tune of R10,000-12,000/ha. Cost of technology R1,500-2,000/ha Impact and benefits The new technology lowers the weed competition from the beginning and saves loss of nutrients to an extent of 30-50%. The saving in weeding cost to an extent of R1,000/ha has been observed. The technology also helps to overcome the labour problem during weeding season. This technology relieves pressure on human labour for weeding, avoids loss of nutrients, cost effective and improves yield. Further, upscaling can be done through demonstrations, KVKs, ATMA and NGOs.

Performance results Fenoxaprop treated plot Echinochloa colona and other grassy weeds have been reported to cause 50-60 per cent yield loss in direct-seeded rice. Due to adoption of improved weed management technologies, the weeds are effectively controlled and the yield increases by 2-3 t/ha. Echinochloa colona is usually not controlled by the traditional practices but it is effectively controlled by the use of fenoxaprop (60 g/ha) as post-emergence (25-30 DAS) using 500 litres of water with knapsack sprayer. Use of bispyribac-sodium at 25 g/ha as post-emergence reduces the weed pressure and results in higher yield of rice.

In India, most of water used for irrigation contains calcium and magnesium. Calcium carbonate is common in arid region. Hydrogen sulphite with calcium carbonate greater than 40 mg/litre promotes formation of precipitation in drippers which adversely affect the water application efficiency and hence crop yield. Specific ion concentration, water pH and temperature play an important role in chemical clogging. Acidification is only alternative to remove such clogging. The use of hydrochloric acid- HCl (36%), sulphuric acid \u2013 H SO (98%) and nitric acid \u2013 2 4 HNO (60%) as per schedule through drip irrigation system can solve the salt 3 clogging problem. Algae and fungi are the major contributors of biological clogging restricting the path of emitters. Chlorination is a main remedy to control the biological clogging. Generally calcium hypochlorite or sodium hypochlorite or chlorine gas can be used for chlorination treatment. Hence the acidification and chlorination is very much important for uniform application of water to each and every plant and at every corner of the field.
